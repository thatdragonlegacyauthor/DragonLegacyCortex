Dragon Legacy: Core Rulebook

Preface: A Legacy for My Family
This book, this world, this entire project—it was built for a party of two: my wife and my son.
If you are reading this, it means you have joined our family at the table. Welcome. I am so glad you are here.
I have always believed that the stories we tell shape who we are. They are the frameworks we use to understand the world and our place in it. For years, I have wanted to build a world for my family, a shared story that we could build together, one that would grow with our son and create a legacy of memories for all of us. This game is that legacy.
The themes you will find within these pages are deeply personal. They are reflections of my own journey and the lessons I hope to pass on. It is a story about finding family in unexpected places, about the scars we carry and how they make us stronger, and about the defiant, sometimes painful, act of holding onto hope in a world that seems determined to crush it. It is a story about the bonds we forge, and how those connections are the only true shield against the darkness.
The soul of this game is a synthesis of the stories that shaped me. From the grim, tragic struggle for survival in Berserk, I took the lesson that hope is most powerful when it is a choice made in the face of despair. From the vibrant, heroic journeys of the Breath of Fire series, I took the unwavering belief in the power of a "found family" to overcome any obstacle. And from the beautiful, melancholic, and deeply personal stories of Legend of Mana, I took the idea that a world's true history is written in the small, quiet moments and the personal tales of the people who inhabit it.
This is a game with a heavy heart, but it is not without hope. It is my sincere wish that you and your own found family will find a piece of yourselves in these pages. Tell your own stories. Make difficult choices. Argue, laugh, and cry. Forge a legacy that is uniquely yours.
Thank you for being a part of ours.
—Novae

Introduction: The Age of Scars
The world of Eryndor is built on a lie.
History tells of a benevolent goddess, Elysia, who saved the world from the chaotic reign of tyrannical Dragon Lords in a cataclysm called "The Shattering." It is a comforting story of order triumphing over chaos, of light over dark.
It is not the truth.
The truth is a tragedy. The Shattering was not a salvation; it was a desperate act of sacrifice. The last of the heroic Dragon Lords gave their lives to imprison a goddess of absolute, silent order who sought to extinguish all free will. The world itself is her cage, and the scars of that battle mark the land and the souls of its people.
This is the world you are born into. It is a world of breathtaking beauty and deep, lingering sorrow, where the echoes of a forgotten heroism clash with the grim realities of a broken present. It is a world that desperately needs heroes, but it is a world that will make them pay for their strength in blood and spirit.
This is a game about Fatalistic Hope. It is about staring into the abyss of a predetermined, tragic fate and choosing to fight anyway, not because you are guaranteed to win, but because of the people standing beside you.
In Dragon Legacy, you will:
Struggle Against Fate: Take on the role of a hero marked by destiny, fighting against the suffocating philosophy of the Champions of Order and the ghosts of a tragic past.
Pay the Cost of Power: Wield incredible abilities that come at a great personal price, risking your mind and body to protect what you love, and bearing the permanent scars of your choices.
Build a Found Family: Journey with a cast of fifteen unique heroes, forging bonds of trust and loyalty that are the only true shield against the darkness. The strength of your fellowship is your greatest weapon.
Explore a Broken World: Discover the fragmented, melancholic beauty of Eryndor, from the soaring ruins of a sky-faring city to the quiet sadness of a petrified forest, and uncover the secret truths it holds.
The game is powered by a simple, narrative-focused engine. When you perform an action, you will gather a pool of dice based on your character's abilities. You will roll them and choose dice to determine the outcome and the magnitude of your success or failure. This streamlined system allows us to focus on the story and the difficult choices your characters will make.
You are not a blank slate. You are one of Eryndor’s fated heroes, a character with a rich history and a unique power. This power is expressed through a Signature Trait and two distinct Paths you can choose to walk, ensuring that your journey is truly your own.
This book will be your guide. In the chapters to come, we will explore the core rules of the game, and then begin a deep dive into the heroes who are the heart of this story, starting with the Dragon Heir herself: Rya.
Welcome to the Age of Scars. Your legacy begins now.

Chapter 2: The Core Engine - The Dance of Dice
In a world defined by a struggle against fate, every action carries weight. The core mechanic of Dragon Legacy is designed to be simple in practice but rich in narrative possibility, allowing us to focus on the story that unfolds from your choices. Every challenge, from swinging a sword to persuading a monarch, is resolved using this same system.
1. The Dice Pool
When you perform an action where the outcome is uncertain, you will gather a dice pool. Look at your character sheet and take one die for each Trait that applies to the situation. A Trait is any of the defining elements of your character, such as:
Attributes: Your character's innate physical and mental capabilities (e.g., Agility, Intellect).
Skills: Your character's learned areas of expertise (e.g., Melee, Lore).
Signature Trait: The unique Trait that defines your hero's core identity (e.g., Rya's Primal Legacy).
Distinctions: Descriptive phrases about your character's personality or history.
Assets: Temporary helpful resources or advantages you have in a scene.
You will gather a handful of dice of various sizes (d6, d8, d10, etc.). This is your dice pool for the action.
2. The Roll: Total and Effect
Once you have your dice, roll them all together. From the results, you will make two important choices:
Choose TWO dice to create your TOTAL. Add the numbers on these two dice together. This sum is your Total, which you will compare to a Difficulty set by the Game Moderator (GM) to determine if your action succeeds.
Choose ONE die to be your EFFECT die. The size of this die (d4, d6, d8, etc.) represents the magnitude and impact of your action. A high Total might mean you succeed, but a high Effect die means you succeed spectacularly. You cannot choose a die that was used for your Total to also be your Effect die.
Example: You are trying to leap across a chasm. You assemble a pool of Agility d8, Athletics d6, and an Asset Firm Footing d8. You roll them and get a 4, a 5, and an 8. You could choose the 5 and 8 for a Total of 13, succeeding the task. You would then use the remaining die, the d6, as your Effect die, meaning you land solidly and with purpose.
3. Plot Points: Bending Fate
Plot Points are your primary resource for influencing the story and defying the cruel hand of fate. They are a currency you and the GM will exchange throughout the game. You are encouraged to spend them freely to ensure your hero survives to fight another day.
You can spend a Plot Point to:
Add a d8 to your dice pool before you roll, giving you more options for your Total and Effect.
Keep an extra die for your Total, adding a third die to the sum for a truly heroic result.
Activate a powerful Talent from one of your character's Paths.
You gain Plot Points when you deliberately choose to make your hero's life more difficult. This can happen when you accept a Complication offered by the GM or when one of your character's Distinctions works against them. This creates the core loop of the game: you embrace struggle and hardship to gain the strength needed to succeed when it matters most.
With these core rules, we have everything we need to begin our journey. In the next chapter, we will begin our deep dive into the heroes of this story, starting with Rya, The Echoing Soul.

Chapter 3: The Heroes of Legacy - The Strugglers
You are not an adventurer for hire. You are not a blank slate waiting to be written upon. You are one of the fifteen fated heroes of Eryndor, a "Struggler" whose life is defined by a battle against a tragic destiny.
Each hero is a unique individual, with a detailed history, a personal stake in the world's fate, and a distinct source of power. In this chapter, we will provide a deep dive into each of them, outlining their story and the mechanics that bring them to life.
Mechanically, each hero is defined by a Signature Trait, a unique Trait that represents the core of their power and identity. This Trait unlocks two distinct Paths—different philosophies or applications of their power—that you can choose from at the beginning of a scene. Each Path contains a set of unique Talents (special effects or SFX) that augment the six core narrative moves, allowing you to bend the rules in ways that are unique to your chosen hero.
We begin with the character whose very soul is a battlefield: Rya.

Rya: The Echoing Soul
“I don’t know who I am, but I know what I must fight for. I just hope I don’t become the monster I’m fighting.”
To play as Rya is to embrace a legacy of forgotten power, terrible sacrifice, and a profound, unanswered question: who are you? An orphan raised in the secluded Scalebound Clans, you know nothing of your true parentage. All you know is the power that burns within you—a chaotic, wild, and overwhelming connection to the dragons of old. You are the last Dragon Heir, a living echo of the mighty beings who gave everything to save the world.
Your journey will not be one of mastering a single skill, but of trying to harmonize the conflicting chorus of voices within your own soul. The greatest danger you face is not the Champions of Order who hunt you, but the corrupting influence of your own Inner Dragon—a primal rage that tempts you to solve your problems with fire and fury, at the cost of your own humanity.
Signature Trait: Primal Legacy This Trait represents your direct, unfiltered connection to the raw creative and destructive forces that shaped Eryndor. It is the source of your incredible versatility, but also your greatest vulnerability.
Core Mechanic: Attunement Rya does not have a fixed set of abilities. Instead, she has the potential to access them all through her central mechanic: Attunement. At the start of any scene, she can spend one Plot Point to attune her Primal Legacy to a single Draconic Legacy (Fire, Ice, Storm, etc.). This attunement lasts for the rest of the scene, infusing her actions with the power of that element. When she attunes, she must also choose which of that Legacy's two Paths she will walk.
Rya's Attunements: The Legacy of Fire
To attune to the Legacy of Fire is to channel the raw, untamed heart of a dragon. It is the power of unrestrained passion, blinding fury, and the forge of creation. Fire is direct, honest, and utterly devastating. When you call upon this Legacy, the very air around you shimmers with heat, and your voice carries the roar of a living furnace. This is the power that feels most natural to your Inner Dragon, and thus, the most tempting and dangerous to wield.
When you attune to the Legacy of Fire, you must choose one of two Paths to walk.

Path of the Inferno: The Uncontrolled Blaze
“Let it all burn.”
This Path embraces the chaotic and destructive nature of fire, a philosophy straight from Berserk's Beast of Darkness. You become a tempest of flame, prioritizing widespread devastation over precision. This is the Path you walk when you are overwhelmed, desperate, or have given in to your rage, letting the Inner Dragon take the reins to break an army or sunder a fortress.
Inferno Talents:
Wildfire: When you use the Barrage move, you can choose to also create a powerful, scene-wide Complication: Raging Inferno d8. This fire affects everyone in the area, friend and foe alike, reflecting the uncontrollable nature of your rage.
Consuming Rage: When an enemy successfully inflicts a Complication or Stress die on you, you may spend a Plot Point to immediately use the Strike move against them as a free action, lashing out with instinctual fury.
Firebreak: You are immune to taking Stress or Complications from any environmental sources of fire or heat.

Path of the Heartfire: The Focused Flame
“A fire in the soul is worth more than a fire in the hand.”
This Path embraces the internal, purifying, and protective nature of fire, reflecting the resilient hope of Breath of Fire. You wield flame not as a weapon of chaos, but as a tool of focused will, much like Ryu learning to control his inner power. This is the Path of the forge, the hearth, and the inner light that burns away corruption and fear, protecting your found family.
Heartfire Talents:
Searing Strike: When you successfully use the Strike move, you can choose to step down your Effect die by one size. If you do, you inflict the Melted Armor d8 Complication on your target in addition to any Stress, representing a focused, armor-piercing attack.
Cauterize: You can use the Bolster move on yourself or an adjacent ally. The fire you summon seals a wound. This move removes a physical Complication or Stress related to bleeding or poison, but at a cost: you must apply the lesser Painful Scars d6 Complication to the target. This is a permanent reminder of the cost of power.
Inner Flame: You can spend a Plot Point to use the Bolster move on yourself, channeling your will into an inner fire that burns away doubt. This removes a single mental Complication like Fear, Doubt, or Discouraged.
Rya's Attunements: The Legacy of Ice
To attune to the Legacy of Ice is to channel the world's stillness and silence. It is the power of preservation and patience, of beauty that can cut like glass, and of a heart that has been frozen to protect itself from pain. This is the influence of Legend of Mana's melancholic beauty and the grim endurance required by the strugglers of Berserk. When you call upon this Legacy, the air around you grows cold and still, and your breath emerges as a cloud of crystalline mist.
When you attune to the Legacy of Ice, you must choose one of two Paths to walk.

Path of the Glacier: The Unstoppable Advance
“Rage is a flash flood. I am the ice that carves the canyon.”
This Path embodies the immense, inexorable power of a glacier, the will to stand firm and protect your found family, as inspired by Breath of Fire. It is a philosophy of defense, endurance, and slow, crushing offense. You become a bastion of frozen might, weathering blows that would shatter others and responding not with speed, but with unstoppable force.
Glacier Talents:
Glacial Armor: You can spend a Plot Point to use Bolster on yourself or an ally, encasing them in a thick layer of magical ice. This immediately creates a Glacial Armor d8 Asset that can absorb Physical Stress.
Unstoppable Force: When an enemy creates a Complication representing difficult or blocked terrain, you may spend a Plot Point to ignore its effects for the scene, as you simply carve a path through it.
Crushing Weight: When you use Strike against a target that is hindered by an icy Complication or is immobile, you may step up your Effect die.

Path of the Rimeheart: The Frozen Shard
“The most beautiful things are the most fragile, and the most deadly.”
This Path embodies the precise, artistic, and sorrowful nature of ice. It is the power of a heart frozen by trauma, lashing out with deadly, beautiful precision. This Path reflects the tragic beauty of Legend of Mana and the personal scars of Berserk. You wield ice not as a blunt instrument, but as a razor-sharp tool for controlling the battlefield and piercing the defenses of your foes.
Rimeheart Talents:
Flash Freeze: When you successfully use the Debilitate move to create an icy Complication on a target (e.g., Frozen Solid d8), you may spend a Plot Point to also inflict Physical Stress equal to the Complication die.
Heart of Winter: You may use the Debilitate move to target a character's emotions. On a success, you inflict the Numbing Sorrow d8 Mental Complication, as a supernatural cold seeps into their heart, draining their will to fight.
Shatter: When you inflict Stress on a target that is already affected by one of your icy Complications, you may spend a Plot Point to step up the Stress die by one as the ice shatters and tears at them.
Dragon Legacy: Core Rulebook - Batch 6
Rya's Attunements: The Legacy of Storm
To attune to the Legacy of Storm is to become a conduit for the sky's untamed, chaotic energy. The storm is a force of sudden change, deafening truth, and liberating fury. It is the flash of insight in the dark and the wind that tears down old structures to make way for the new. This Legacy embodies the defiant spark of hope from Breath of Fire and the chaotic, world-changing events of Berserk's Fantasia arc. When you call upon this Legacy, the air around you crackles with static, and arcs of lightning dance along your limbs.
When you attune to the Legacy of Storm, you must choose one of two Paths to walk.

Path of the Tempest: The Unbroken Gale
“They think they can chain the wind. I will show them how fragile their chains are.”
This Path embodies the overwhelming, chaotic, and liberating power of a raging storm. You become a whirlwind of motion and energy, prioritizing speed, disruption, and area control. This is the Path of heroic, desperate freedom, chosen when you need to break an enemy formation, outmaneuver a superior force, or tear across the battlefield like a bolt of lightning to save a member of your found family.
Tempest Talents:
Ride the Lightning: When you use the Maneuver move, you may spend a Plot Point to transform into a bolt of lightning, instantly moving to any visible point in the scene. You may take one ally with you.
Chain Lightning: When you successfully use Strike to inflict Stress with an electrical attack, you may spend a Plot Point. If you do, a smaller bolt arcs to a second target near your first, inflicting Stress equal to your Effect die stepped down by one size.
Eye of the Storm: You are immune to Complications caused by wind, lightning, or impaired visibility due to weather.

Path of the Fulcrum: The Stillness Within
“The calmest moment is the one between the lightning and the thunder.”
This Path embodies the moment of perfect, terrifying clarity at the heart of the storm. It is the power of sudden insight, shocking revelation, and the precise application of force, reflecting the melancholic introspection of Legend of Mana. You wield the storm's energy not as a chaotic gale, but as a focused instrument to find and exploit your enemy's weaknesses, often revealing a painful or difficult truth in the process.
Fulcrum Talents:
Sudden Flash: You can use the Debilitate move to create a blinding flash of light and a deafening crack of thunder. On a success, you inflict the Dazed and Disoriented d8 Complication on all enemies in your immediate vicinity.
Shocking Truth: You can spend a Plot Point when using Bolster on an ally to remove a mental Complication like Confused or Deceived. The jolt of insight you provide is startling but effective, revealing a core truth they were avoiding.
Static Charge: When an enemy makes a physical attack against you and fails, you may inflict the Statically Charged d6 Complication on them as a free action. If they are attacked with lightning while this Complication is active, it is triggered, inflicting Stress of the same die size.
Rya's Attunements: The Legacy of Earth
To attune to the Legacy of Earth is to connect with the immense, enduring, and patient power of Eryndor itself. Earth is the power of resilience, stability, and history. It is the unyielding mountain that weathers every storm and the fertile soil that gives birth to all life. It represents the stubborn refusal to be broken, a theme central to the strugglers of Berserk, and the deep connection to the world that the heroes of Breath of Fire fight to protect.
When you call upon this Legacy, the ground feels steadier beneath your feet. The scent of rich soil and ancient stone fills the air, and your skin may take on the hardness and texture of rock.

Path of the Mountain: The Unbreakable Shield
“Let them break themselves upon me. I will not be moved.”
This Path embodies the defensive, immovable, and eternal nature of the mountain. It is a philosophy of protection and resilience, focused on shielding your found family and holding the line against impossible odds. You become a bastion of stone and will, an anchor in the storm that allows your allies to endure and triumph.
Mountain Talents:
Stone Aegis: When you or an ally near you is targeted by a Strike, you may spend a Plot Point to intercept it. Create a Wall of Stone d8 Asset and use it as a defense for that attack. The wall remains for the rest of the scene or until it is destroyed.
Rooted Stance: You are immune to any Complications or involuntary movement that would knock you prone or move you from your position, as long as you are standing on solid ground.
Earthen Ward: You can use the Bolster move to grant an ally a blessing of the earth. This removes a physical Complication and grants them the Stone-Skin d6 Asset for the next turn.

Path of the Tremor: The Sundered Earth
“The world beneath your feet is not as stable as you believe.”
This Path embodies the destructive and raw power that slumbers beneath the earth's placid surface. It is the earthquake that topples cities and the tectonic fury that reshapes continents. This Path reflects the world-shattering events of our core inspirations, using the very foundation of the world as a weapon to control the battlefield and shatter your enemies' footing.
Tremor Talents:
Earthshaker: When you use the Barrage move, you can spend a Plot Point to strike the ground, sending a shockwave out in a wide area. Instead of inflicting Stress, you inflict the Unstable Ground d8 Complication on all characters (friend and foe) in the zone who are touching the ground.
Fissure: When you use the Debilitate move, you can spend a Plot Point to open a deep fissure in the earth, creating a Chasm d10 Complication that can divide the battlefield, separating enemies or protecting allies.
Stone Fist: When you use the Strike move and your target is affected by a Complication related to difficult terrain or being immobilized, you may step up your Effect die as the earth itself aids your attack.
Rya's Attunements: The Legacy of Light
To attune to the Legacy of Light is to channel the brilliant, burning fire of life and truth. Light is the power of revelation, purity, and indomitable will. It is the gentle, warm glow that knits wounds and the searing, cleansing beam that burns away corruption. This Legacy represents the unwavering hope of a found family from Breath of Fire and the sacred, often dogmatic, power structures seen in Legend of Mana.
When you call upon this Legacy, a soft, golden radiance may emanate from you. Your voice becomes clear and resonant, and your touch can bring a calming warmth to your allies.

Path of the Dawn: The Unwavering Beacon
“So long as one of us holds the light, the darkness will never win.”
This Path embodies the protective, healing, and inspiring nature of light. It is a philosophy of hope and community, focused on shielding your allies from harm and mending their bodies and spirits. You become a beacon of hope on the battlefield, a symbol of resilience that empowers your found family to fight on against impossible odds.
Dawn Talents:
Shield of Light: When you or an ally is targeted by an attack, you may spend a Plot Point to use Bolster, creating a Barrier of Light d8 Asset to defend against it.
Healing Radiance: You can spend a Plot Point when using the Bolster move to send out a pulse of healing light. This removes a d6 Physical Stress die from yourself and every ally in your immediate vicinity.
Beacon of Hope: When you successfully overcome a major obstacle or defeat a significant foe, you can choose to create the Inspired d6 Asset for your entire party for the next scene.

Path of the Judgment: The Cleansing Flame
“The truth can be a terrible weapon. Let it be mine.”
This Path embodies the severe, uncompromising, and revealing nature of light. This is not a gentle glow, but the searing light of truth that exposes every lie and burns away all shadows. It reflects the harsh, often cruel, righteousness of a character like Farnese from Berserk. This Path is about judging your enemies, purging corruption, and revealing painful, hidden truths.
Judgment Talents:
Searing Rebuke: When you use the Strike move against an enemy with a Void or shadow-based nature, you may step up your Effect die.
Purge Corruption: You may use the Debilitate move to target a creature's unnatural abilities. On a success, you can create the Complication Power Disrupted d8, which temporarily shuts down one of the target's special powers.
Unwavering Gaze: You can spend a Plot Point when making an Insight-based roll to see through lies or illusions. You are immune to deception for the rest of the scene, as you perceive only the stark, painful truth.
Rya's Attunements: The Legacy of Void
To attune to the Legacy of Void is to touch the chilling emptiness between the stars. The Void is the power of secrets, entropy, and the terrifying abyss that waits at the end of all things. It is not an evil force, but a neutral one—the silence that consumes all noise, the darkness that consumes all light. This Legacy is deeply connected to the fatalistic themes of Berserk, representing the crushing weight of causality and the inner demons that characters must face.
When you call upon this Legacy, the shadows in the area seem to deepen and stretch towards you. The air grows unnaturally still, and your voice may become a low whisper that is somehow audible over the loudest roar.

Path of the Penumbra: The Lingering Shadow
“The brightest light casts the darkest shadow. I will be that shadow.”
This Path embodies the subtle, deceptive, and insidious nature of the Void. It is a philosophy of stealth, misdirection, and psychological warfare, inspired by the melancholic tricksters and hidden sorrows of Legend of Mana. You do not destroy your enemies with overwhelming force, but with the doubts and fears you plant in their own minds. You become a ghost, a rumor, a chilling presence that breaks your enemies' will long before their bodies fail.
Penumbra Talents:
Shadow Step: When you use the Maneuver move while in an area with shadows, you can spend a Plot Point to vanish and reappear in any other shadow in the scene.
Whispers of Doubt: When you successfully use the Debilitate move, you can choose to inflict a mental Complication instead of a physical one, such as Crippling Doubt d8 or Overwhelming Paranoia d8, as you whisper secrets from the Void into their mind.
Veil of Silence: You can spend a Plot Point to use Bolster, creating an Aura of Silence d8 Asset around yourself or an ally. This aura muffles all sound within it, making it perfect for stealth or negating sound-based abilities.

Path of the Abyss: The Consuming Maw
“All things end. I am simply the means.”
This Path embodies the terrifying, all-consuming hunger of the abyss. It is a philosophy of annihilation, entropy, and the inevitable end of all things. This Path directly channels the grim, overwhelming power of a Berserk-style apostle. You wield the Void not as a tool of subtlety, but as a weapon of ultimate destruction, unmaking your foes and draining the very life and energy from the world around you. Wielding this power takes a heavy toll, often scarring the user's soul.
Abyss Talents:
Entropy Strike: When you use the Strike move, you can choose to also drain a portion of your target's power. In addition to inflicting Stress, you may give the target a Power Drain d6 Complication and remove a similar d6 Complication from yourself.
Gravity Well: When you use the Barrage move, you can spend a Plot Point to create a crushing gravity well. Instead of inflicting Stress, all enemies in a zone gain the Crushing Gravity d8 Complication, making movement difficult and draining their stamina.
Touch of the Void: When you are touching a non-living object, you may spend a Plot Point to inflict the Rapid Decay d10 Complication on it, causing it to rust, rot, or turn to dust with terrifying speed.

Selra: The Shepherd
“I once prayed for salvation. Now, I know you can’t pray for something you have to make for yourself, with your own two hands.”
To play as Selra is to embody the struggle of a healer in a world that seems determined to break you. You were once a devout acolyte of the Elysian faith, a true believer in the goddess of order and the righteousness of her Champions. You saw your healing abilities as a divine gift, a way to bring Elysia's peace to a suffering world. That faith was shattered when you witnessed the Champions of Order commit an unforgivable act of cruelty in the name of their "perfect order."
You fled the clergy, a heretic and an outcast, your connection to your own power now a source of confusion and pain. You are no longer a vessel for a goddess's will; you are simply a person with the ability to mend what is broken, searching for a new cause worthy of your gift. Your journey is one of rediscovering your purpose, not in a divine text, but in the faces of the found family you now protect.
Signature Trait: Shattered Faith This Trait represents your complex relationship with your own healing power. It is no longer a pure, divine gift, but something you must now fuel with your own spirit, your own life force. It is a power that comes at a great personal cost, a direct reflection of our Berserk-inspired theme of sacrifice.
Selra's Two Paths
Your shattered faith has forced you to find a new way to wield your power. Do you embrace the sacrifice your old faith demanded, but for a new cause? Or do you twist the doctrines you once revered into something new and dangerous?
Path of the Martyr: This Path focuses on the ultimate act of empathy: taking the pain of others into yourself. Your abilities are centered on powerful healing and protection, but they require you to take on the Stress and Complications of your allies, bearing their burdens as your own.
Path of the Heretic: This Path weaponizes your intimate knowledge of the Elysian faith. You twist sacred rites into debilitating curses and use the symbols of order to expose the hypocrisy of your former masters. It is a path of righteous fury, focused on debuffing and dismantling your enemies from the inside out.
Selra's Paths: Martyr or Heretic
As a Shepherd who has lost her flock, you must now choose how to wield the power you once believed was a divine gift. Do you turn that power inward, embracing sacrifice for your new family, or do you turn it outward, as a weapon against the old one?

Path of the Martyr: The Selfless Heart
“Let me bear this burden for you. My shoulders are strong enough for us both.”
This Path fully embraces the ideals of sacrifice, not for a distant goddess, but for the tangible lives of your companions. It is the philosophy of the found family, the core tenet of Breath of Fire, taken to its painful, logical extreme. You absorb the wounds of your allies, taking their pain into yourself so that they may continue the fight. It is a path of immense resilience and profound empathy.
Martyr Talents:
Vicar of Suffering: When an ally within arm's reach takes Physical or Mental Stress, you may choose to take that Stress die on yourself as a free action. If you do, your ally takes none.
Shared Burden: You can use the Bolster move on an ally to take one of their physical Complications onto yourself (e.g., Broken Arm d8). The Complication die is stepped down by one size when you do so, reflecting your ability to manage the pain.
Martyr's Resilience: You can spend a Plot Point when you take a Stress die to immediately step it down by one size before adding it to your Stress track.

Path of the Heretic: The Unsheathed Truth
“They used faith as a shield. I will use it as a sword.”
This Path weaponizes your intimate knowledge of the Elysian faith and its rituals. You have seen the hypocrisy at the heart of the order, and you now twist its sacred rites into debilitating curses. This is the path of righteous, focused fury, inspired by the struggle against corrupt institutions in our core themes. You dismantle your enemies not with raw power, but by turning their own beliefs and strengths against them.
Heretic Talents:
Anathema: You can use the Debilitate move against a follower of the Elysian faith. On a success, you inflict the Crisis of Faith d8 Mental Complication, as you speak a blasphemy that shakes them to their core.
Rite of Castigation: Spend a Plot Point when using Debilitate. Instead of a normal Complication, you can choose to temporarily shut down one of your target’s Signature Traits for their next turn by creating the Power Sealed d8 Complication.
Expose Falsehood: When an enemy uses their authority or faith to try and influence others, you may spend a Plot Point to create an Asset, Revealed Hypocrisy d8, which can be used by anyone making an opposing social roll against them.

Nina: The Sky-Princess
“This city is my home. Its people are my family. But this gilded cage is the only world I’ve ever known, and I can hear the sky calling my name.”
To play as Nina is to navigate the impossible balance between duty and desire. You are the beloved princess of Wyndia, a breathtaking city that floats among the clouds, a remnant of a forgotten age of wonders. Your life has been one of gilded privilege and crushing responsibility. You are the political and spiritual leader of your people, the voice that guides them, and the living symbol of their enduring legacy.
But Wyndia is a city of secrets. Its serene beauty hides a slow decay, and the weight of keeping it afloat falls squarely on your shoulders. You are a prisoner of your own crown, bound by ancient protocols and the expectations of your people. Your journey is one of discovery—of the world below, of the found family that shows you a different kind of loyalty, and of the true nature of your own power, which is tied not just to your royal blood, but to the wild, free spirits of the sky itself. This mirrors the classic Breath of Fire narrative of a winged princess finding her strength outside her kingdom's walls.
Signature Trait: Voice of Wyndia This Trait represents your royal authority and your innate connection to the elemental spirits of the sky that keep your city aloft. It is the power to command, to inspire, and to call upon the very winds of Eryndor for aid.
Nina's Two Paths
Your power is a direct reflection of your core conflict. Do you embrace the role you were born into, wielding the authority of your station? Or do you answer the call of the open sky, embracing the wild freedom you've always craved?
Path of the Gale: This Path is the call of the wild sky. It focuses on your elemental connection to the wind, allowing you to manipulate air currents for powerful offensive and defensive maneuvers. It is the Path of freedom, speed, and untamed natural power.
Path of the Decree: This Path is the voice of the leader. It focuses on your royal authority and your ability to command and inspire others. Your power comes not from raw elemental force, but from issuing commands that your allies and even your enemies are compelled to obey.
Nina's Paths: Gale or Decree
As the Sky-Princess, you are torn between the freedom you crave and the duty you were born to. Do you embrace the wild, untamed power of the sky, or do you wield the authority that is your birthright?

Path of the Gale: The Unfettered Wind
“You cannot cage the wind. You cannot command the storm. And you cannot hold me.”
This Path is the call of the wild sky, a full embrace of your elemental connection to the wind. It is a philosophy of freedom, speed, and untamed natural power, inspired by the classic magical abilities of characters from Legend of Mana. You become a tempest on the battlefield, using the air currents to maneuver with impossible grace and strike with the force of a hurricane.
Gale Talents:
Tailwind: You can spend a Plot Point when using the Maneuver move to grant yourself and all allies in your immediate vicinity the Wind-Carried d8 Asset, allowing for enhanced movement for one turn.
Cutting Gale: When you use the Barrage move, you can create a whirlwind of razor-sharp wind. You may choose to inflict the Bleeding d6 Complication on any one target you hit, in addition to any Stress.
Updraft: You can use your connection to the wind to leap and glide short distances, allowing you to ignore the effects of difficult terrain and cross gaps you otherwise could not.

Path of the Decree: The Voice of Command
“By the authority vested in me by the city of Wyndia and the spirits of the sky, I command you: stand down.”
This Path is the voice of the leader. It focuses on your royal authority and your almost supernatural ability to command and inspire. This is not the brute force of a tyrant, but the resonant, undeniable authority of a true leader from a heroic tale like Breath of Fire. Your power comes not from raw elemental force, but from issuing commands that your allies—and sometimes, even your enemies—are compelled to obey through sheer force of will.
Decree Talents:
Royal Decree: You can use the Debilitate move to issue a direct command to a single target (e.g., "Drop your weapon!", "Flee!"). Spend a Plot Point. If you succeed on your roll, the target must either obey the command or take Mental Stress equal to your Effect die.
Inspiring Presence: When you use the Bolster move to aid an ally, you may step up the Effect die. Your words of encouragement and tactical guidance give them renewed strength and purpose.
Sovereign Territory: When you are within the bounds of your home city of Wyndia, you may spend a Plot Point to add a d10 to your dice pool for any social roll. Here, your voice is law.
Zael: The Whisperer
“There is a voice in my head. It offers me power, knowledge, beauty… everything I have ever wanted. I know I shouldn't listen. But I don't know how much longer I can refuse.”
To play as Zael is to walk a razor's edge between ambition and annihilation. You are a striking, ethereal figure, blessed with a natural talent for magic that has always set you apart. But your gift is also your curse. Years ago, you stumbled upon a place where the veil between worlds was thin, and something ancient and hungry noticed you. Now, you are haunted by a constant, seductive whisper in your mind—a voice that promises you unimaginable power if you would only give in.
This entity, which you have come to know as the "Whisperer," offers you shortcuts to the power you crave, revealing secrets of the Void that other mages spend lifetimes trying to comprehend. But you know, instinctively, that every gift it gives you comes at a price, and that its ultimate goal is not to help you, but to consume you. Your journey is a constant, desperate struggle for control, a battle fought within the confines of your own mind. This is a direct reflection of the Berserk theme of the "inner monster," where the greatest enemy is the darkness within oneself.
Signature Trait: Void-Touched This Trait represents your perilous connection to the Whispering entity and the corrupting Void magic it channels through you. It is a source of incredible, forbidden power, but one that constantly threatens to overwhelm your sanity and your soul.
Zael's Two Paths
Your struggle is a constant negotiation with the voice in your head. Do you try to resist it, using only the bare minimum of its tainted power? Or do you lean into its promises, wielding the abyss as a weapon, hoping you can control it before it controls you?
Path of the Veil: This Path focuses on subtlety, illusion, and control. You use the Void's power to cloud minds, conceal your presence, and manipulate the perceptions of others, all while trying to keep the Whisperer's influence at arm's length. It is the Path of resistance.
Path of the Abyss: This Path is one of terrifying, direct power. You open a direct channel to the Whisperer, unleashing raw, entropic Void magic upon your enemies. It offers immense destructive potential, but each use risks pulling you deeper into the darkness and strengthening the entity's hold on you. It is the Path of dangerous acceptance.
Zael's Paths: Veil or Abyss
Your life is a constant negotiation with the Whisperer. Do you fight its influence, using its tainted gifts with caution and restraint? Or do you embrace the terrifying power it offers, risking your very soul for the strength to protect your friends?

Path of the Veil: The Resisting Mind
“I will use its knowledge, but I will not become its puppet.”
This Path focuses on subtlety, illusion, and control. It represents your active resistance against the Whisperer's influence. You draw on the Void's power to cloud minds, conceal your presence, and manipulate the perceptions of others, turning your curse into a tool for espionage and misdirection. This is the path of a spy master from a heroic fantasy, using the enemy's own power against them, but the constant mental battle takes a toll, reflecting the melancholic struggle of a Legend of Mana hero.
Veil Talents:
Veil of Whispers: You can spend a Plot Point to use Bolster, weaving a cloak of shadows and distorted sound around yourself or an ally. This creates a Concealed d8 Asset for stealth-related actions.
Mirror of the Mind: When an enemy attempts to use a mental or psychic ability against you, you may spend a Plot Point to create a Psychic Feedback d8 Complication on them as you turn the Whisperer's defenses outward.
Silent Illusion: You can use the Maneuver move to create a minor, silent illusion (such as a false wall, a distracting sound, or a hiding place) by creating a d6 Asset. This illusion cannot cause harm but can provide cover or create a diversion.

Path of the Abyss: The Open Conduit
“If this is the price for the power to save them… then I will pay it.”
This Path is one of terrifying, direct power. It represents a dangerous bargain with your inner demon, a conscious choice to open a direct channel to the Whisperer and unleash raw, entropic Void magic. This path offers immense destructive potential, directly mirroring the devastating power and terrible cost of the Berserker Armor from Berserk. Each use strengthens the Whisperer's hold, and the power you unleash is often as dangerous to the environment as it is to your foes.
Abyss Talents:
Abyssal Strike: When you use the Strike move, you may choose to inflict the Void-Scarred d6 Complication on yourself. If you do, step up your Effect die by one, as you channel an unfiltered stream of entropic energy.
Hungering Void: When you successfully defeat a significant enemy using a Void-powered ability, you can choose to remove a d6 Mental Stress from yourself, as the Whisperer is temporarily sated by the victory.
Unravel: You can spend a Plot Point when using the Debilitate move to target an inanimate object. On a success, the object begins to rapidly decay, inflicting a Disintegrating d10 Complication on it.

Garrick: The Vengeful Spirit
“Justice died with me. All that’s left is revenge.”
To play as Garrick is to be an echo of a life that was stolen from you. You were once a loyal knight, a paragon of virtue sworn to a noble lord. You were betrayed, murdered alongside your master, and left to rot in an unmarked grave. But your sense of duty—or perhaps, your burning hatred—was too strong to let you pass on. You rose again, no longer a man of flesh and blood, but a spectral suit of armor animated by a singular, all-consuming purpose: vengeance.
Your existence is a grim reflection of Berserk's core theme of a life defined by a quest for revenge. You are a ghost, unmoored from the world of the living, and your memories of your past life are fading, replaced by the cold, hard certainty of your mission. You travel with the heroes not out of altruism, but because their path aligns with your hunt. The greatest danger you face is that once you have taken your revenge, there will be nothing left of the man you once were, leaving only an empty, drifting spirit.
Signature Trait: Bound by Vengeance This Trait is the anchor that ties your spirit to the mortal plane. It is the source of your ghostly powers and your unholy resilience. It grows stronger when you pursue your vendetta but fades when your purpose becomes clouded, making it a constant, demanding master.
Garrick's Two Paths
Your undeath has granted you unique and terrifying powers. Do you embrace the ghostly abilities that make you a perfect assassin, or do you channel your undying rage to become an unstoppable spectral juggernaut?
Path of the Phantom: This Path focuses on your incorporeal nature. You become a true phantom, moving through walls, becoming invisible, and striking from angles your enemies cannot predict. It is the Path of the silent, unseen killer.
Path of the Juggernaut: This Path weaponizes your single-minded rage. You forsake subtlety for overwhelming, terrifying force. You become an unstoppable engine of destruction, shrugging off blows that would fell a mortal man and crushing your foes through sheer, relentless aggression.
Garrick's Paths: Phantom or Juggernaut
As a spirit bound to a suit of armor, your very existence is a weapon. Do you embrace the spectral abilities that allow you to become an unseen, untouchable killer? Or do you channel your undying rage to become a terrifying and unstoppable force of destruction on the battlefield?

Path of the Phantom: The Unseen Blade
“You can’t fight a memory. You can't kill a ghost. And you can't see me coming.”
This Path focuses on your incorporeal nature, turning you into a true phantom. It is a philosophy of stealth, misdirection, and the single, perfect strike from an unexpected angle. This Path draws from the grim realities of assassination in a world like Berserk, where a single, well-placed blow is more effective than a thousand wild swings. You become a whisper, a flicker in the corner of the eye, and a chilling presence that your enemies feel long before they see.
Phantom Talents:
Incorporeal Step: You can spend a Plot Point when using the Maneuver move to pass through solid objects like walls or doors for a single turn. You must end your movement in an open space.
From the Grave: If you use Strike on a target that is unaware of your presence, you may step up your Effect die by one size.
Ghostly Form: You cannot be physically grappled, restrained, or knocked prone. Such attempts simply pass through you. You can choose to become solid to interact with objects or people when you wish.

Path of the Juggernaut: The Unstoppable Hate
“My body is a cage of steel. My spirit is a fire of pure hate. Come, try and stop me.”
This Path weaponizes your single-minded rage and the unyielding nature of your armored form. You forsake subtlety for overwhelming, terrifying force, becoming an unstoppable engine of destruction. This Path is the embodiment of the "Struggler" from Berserk—a being that simply refuses to fall, driven forward by sheer will and fury. You wade through enemy lines, shrugging off blows that would fell giants, your every step a thunderous declaration of your intent.
Juggernaut Talents:
Unfeeling Steel: When you take Physical Stress, you may spend a Plot Point to step the die down by one size before adding it to your Stress track. Your spectral form feels no pain, and your armor deflects the worst of the blow.
Relentless Advance: You are immune to any mental Complication or Stress related to fear or intimidation. Such attempts only fuel your anger. You may spend a Plot Point to convert a fear-based attack against you into an Enraged d6 Asset for your next roll.
Sundering Blow: When you use the Strike move to attack an object, such as a gate or a wall, you may double your Bound by Vengeance die in your dice pool.


Kei: The Pack Leader
“A true alpha leads from the front, but my pack drove me out. I will return, not for vengeance, but to remind them what loyalty to the Frostfang truly means.”
To play as Kei is to fight for a home that has rejected you. You are the rightful heir to the leadership of the Frostfang Packs, a proud and fiercely independent clan of hunters who have survived for generations in the harshest, coldest reaches of Eryndor. You were raised to be the alpha, to lead the hunt, and to uphold the traditions of your people. But your uncle, driven by ambition and a lust for power, forged an alliance with outsiders—the Arcane Dominion—and used their influence to brand you a traitor and cast you out.
Now you are an alpha without a pack, an exile wandering a world that is far more complex and dangerous than your icy home. Your journey is one of reclamation. You must gather new allies and grow stronger, not to satisfy a personal lust for revenge, but to free your people from the corrupting influence that has taken root in your absence. This quest for a lost throne and the preservation of one's people is a classic heroic arc, reminiscent of the noble struggles in Breath of Fire.
Signature Trait: Frostfang Alpha This Trait represents your innate authority and your mastery of the pack-hunting tactics of your people. It is the voice that can command respect, the instincts that can track any prey, and the unyielding spirit of a leader who has endured the ultimate test of survival.
Kei's Two Paths
Your training as a hunter and a leader has given you a unique set of skills. Do you embrace the instincts of a lone wolf, becoming the perfect predator? Or do you embody the spirit of the alpha, empowering your new pack to hunt as one?
Path of the Lone Wolf: This Path focuses on your skills as a solitary hunter and survivor. You become a master of stealth, tracking, and the decisive, lethal strike that brings down prey before it even knows it's being hunted.
Path of the Pack Leader: This Path channels your innate authority as an alpha. Your abilities are centered on battlefield command and tactical coordination. You do not just fight; you direct the flow of combat, creating openings for your allies and turning your found family into a ruthlessly efficient hunting pack.
Kei's Paths: Lone Wolf or Pack Leader
As an exiled alpha, you must reconcile your training with your reality. Do you lean into the harsh lessons of solitary survival, becoming a perfect predator? Or do you embrace your innate leadership to forge a new, more diverse pack from the heroes who stand with you?

Path of the Lone Wolf: The Perfect Predator
“My pack is gone. My hunt is my own. I am the only one I can rely on.”
This Path focuses on your skills as a solitary hunter and survivor. It is the philosophy of self-reliance, honed to a razor's edge by the brutal realities of exile. You become a master of stealth, tracking, and the decisive, lethal strike, embodying the patient, stoic nature of your arctic homeland. This Path reflects the lonely struggle of a character like Guts from Berserk—a warrior who must become the pinnacle of their craft to survive alone.
Lone Wolf Talents:
Alpha Predator: When you use Strike on a target that is unaware of your presence or is the last remaining enemy in a scene, you may step up your Effect die.
Hunter's Senses: You may spend a Plot Point to perfectly track any creature for the remainder of a scene, as long as you have a trail to follow. Environmental conditions like rain or snow do not hinder you.
Ghost of the Tundra: When you are in a natural, snowy, or wilderness environment, you may use the Maneuver move to create a Perfectly Hidden d8 Asset for yourself without spending a Plot Point.

Path of the Pack Leader: The Alpha's Howl
“This is my pack now. We hunt together. We survive together. We will not be broken.”
This Path channels your innate authority as an alpha, a core theme of community and leadership from Breath of Fire. Your abilities are centered on battlefield command and tactical coordination. You do not just fight for yourself; you direct the flow of combat, creating openings for your allies and turning your found family into a ruthlessly efficient hunting pack that is greater than the sum of its parts.
Pack Leader Talents:
Harrier Tactics: You can use the Debilitate move to coordinate with an ally. You create a Harried d8 Complication on a target, and the next ally to attack that target may add a d6 to their dice pool.
Pack Leader's Rally: You can spend a Plot Point when using Bolster to remove a Mental Complication (like Fear or Discouraged) from yourself and all allies who can hear your rallying cry.
Coordinated Strike: When an ally succeeds on a Strike roll against an enemy near you, you may spend a Plot Point to immediately make your own Strike against the same target, taking advantage of the opening they created.
Lirien: The Ghost Panther
“The jungle does not forgive. It does not forget. And it has a very long memory for those who trespass against it.”
To play as Lirien is to be a living extension of one of Eryndor’s deadliest environments: the Serpent’s Maw Jungle. You are a master hunter, an apex predator of a clan that lives in the canopy. Your people are rarely seen, considered more legend than reality by outsiders. You move through the treetops with an unnatural grace, your senses honed to a razor's edge, and your knowledge of the jungle's secrets—its hidden paths, its lethal flora, and its monstrous fauna—is absolute.
Your journey is not one of personal grievance or a quest for a lost throne, but one of grim necessity. An external threat, likely the careless expansion of the Arcane Dominion or the corrupting influence of the Brood of Dragnor, has begun to poison the Serpent's Maw. Your clan has sent you, their deadliest hunter, into the outside world to track this poison to its source and eliminate it. You are a protector, not of a kingdom, but of an entire ecosystem. This deep, almost spiritual connection to nature reflects the themes of preservation found in Legend of Mana.
Signature Trait: Jungle Predator This Trait represents your absolute mastery of your environment and your skills as a hunter. It is your preternatural senses, your perfect camouflage, and your intimate knowledge of how to use the jungle itself as a weapon.
Lirien's Two Paths
Your skills as a hunter can be applied in two distinct ways. Do you focus on the arts of the silent, unseen killer, using the jungle’s own venoms to bring down your prey? Or do you call upon the jungle’s monstrous inhabitants, becoming a master of beasts who fights alongside the very creatures others fear?
Path of the Stalker: This Path focuses on stealth, assassination, and the use of deadly poisons. You are the perfect, unseen killer, striking from the shadows and disappearing back into the canopy before your victim even hits the ground.
Path of the Beastmaster: This Path embodies your deep connection with the fauna of the Serpent's Maw. You can communicate with and command the jungle's beasts, from tiny poison frogs to massive, hulking predators, turning the environment’s inhabitants into your loyal pack.
Lirien's Paths: Stalker or Beastmaster
As the sworn protector of the Serpent's Maw, you must choose how to best embody the jungle's will. Do you become its silent, unseen blade, striking with the deadly precision of a hunting panther? Or do you become its voice, calling upon its monstrous children to fight alongside you?

Path of the Stalker: The Unseen Death
“A proper hunt is a silent conversation between predator and prey. Mine is a monologue.”
This Path focuses on stealth, assassination, and the use of the jungle's most potent venoms. You are the perfect, unseen killer, a ghost in the canopy. This Path embodies the cold, lethal efficiency of a predator, drawing on the grim, survivalist tones of Berserk. You do not engage in honorable combat; you end fights before your opponent is even aware they have begun, a silent, deadly instrument of the jungle's wrath.
Stalker Talents:
Canopy Ghost: When you are in a forest or jungle environment, you can spend a Plot Point to use the Maneuver move to become Perfectly Hidden d10 for the rest of the scene, as long as you remain in the trees or dense undergrowth.
Venom-Tipped: You can spend a Plot Point before making a Strike to coat your weapon in a potent toxin. If the attack succeeds, in addition to any Stress, you also inflict the Lethal Poison d8 Complication on the target.
Predator's Instinct: When you are hidden from an enemy, you may add a d8 to your dice pool for any roll made to perceive or analyze them. You notice every weakness, every opening, every flaw in their defenses.

Path of the Beastmaster: The Untamed Pack
“The jungle and I are one. Its claws are my claws. Its fangs are my fangs. Let us hunt together.”
This Path embodies your deep, spiritual connection with the fauna of the Serpent's Maw, a direct reflection of the "found family" theme, expanded to include the natural world itself. You are not just a hunter; you are an alpha, a leader who can communicate with and command the jungle's beasts. This Path, inspired by the communal and nature-focused aspects of Breath of Fire and Legend of Mana, allows you to fight alongside a pack of loyal animal companions, turning the environment itself into your greatest ally.
Beastmaster Talents:
Call the Pack: You can spend a Plot Point to use the Maneuver move to summon a Beast Companion d8 Asset to your side. This could be a pair of swift raptors, a powerful jungle cat, or a swarm of venomous insects. You can only have one such Asset active at a time.
Primal Synergy: When you are adjacent to a friendly beast (either a summoned companion or a creature you have pacified), you may add a d6 to your dice pools for any combat actions.
Beast Tamer: You can use the Bolster move to calm a hostile beast. On a success, you can de-escalate the situation, turning a violent creature into a neutral or even friendly one for the remainder of the scene, unless it is attacked.

Torr: The Bastion
“My people were taught to build, to create, to endure. Our walls never fell. Our forges never cooled. Until now. I am all that is left of that strength.”
To play as Torr is to be the last remnant of a legacy of endurance. You are an exile from the Runeforge, a subterranean city of master craftsmen and smiths whose creations were the envy of the world. Your people, the Remnants, were not warriors; they were builders, artisans who valued resilience and creation above all else. They were betrayed and their home destroyed by the Arcane Dominion, who coveted their secrets of artifice. You are one of the few who escaped the slaughter.
Now, you are a smith without a forge, a guardian with nothing left to protect. Your journey is defined by the core themes of Breath of Fire and Legend of Mana: the quest to preserve a dying culture and the melancholic burden of being the last of your kind. You carry the weight of your entire civilization on your shoulders, seeking not vengeance, but a way to ensure that the legacy of the Runeforge Remnants does not fade from the world entirely.
Signature Trait: Unbending Will This Trait represents the core philosophy of your people: to endure. It is your unshakable resolve, your mastery of defense, and your ability to withstand physical and mental hardships that would break any ordinary person.
Torr's Two Paths
As the last bastion of your people, you must choose how to embody their strength. Do you focus on the art of creation, using the Runeforge's secrets to build and protect? Or do you embrace the art of the guardian, becoming an immovable, unbreakable wall between your new family and the cruelties of the world?
Path of the Forge Master: This Path channels your skills as a master artisan and smith. You are a creator, capable of crafting masterwork armor, weapons, and potent runic devices on the fly, providing your allies with the tools they need to survive.
Path of the Unbreakable Wall: This Path embodies your role as a protector. You become the ultimate defender, an immovable object of pure resilience. Your abilities are centered on absorbing damage, shielding your allies, and controlling the battlefield through sheer, unyielding presence.
Torr's Paths: Forge Master or Unbreakable Wall
As the last scion of the Runeforge, you carry the legacy of your people. Do you choose to preserve their memory by becoming a master creator, a smith who can arm a revolution? Or do you embody their most cherished value, becoming an unbreakable shield for the allies who have become your new home?

Path of the Forge Master: The Unsleeping Smith
“Steel can be a weapon, or a shield, or a home. I can make you all three before breakfast.”
This Path channels your skills as a master artisan and smith. It is a philosophy of creation and preparation, reflecting the deep crafting systems of Legend of Mana and the hope of rebuilding a future from the ashes of the past. You are a creator, capable of using your knowledge of runes and metal to craft masterwork items, fortify positions, and provide your allies with the tools they need to overcome any obstacle.
Forge Master Talents:
Masterwork On Demand: You can spend a Plot Point to use Bolster, rapidly upgrading an ally's weapon or armor. This creates a Masterwork Quality d8 Asset that can be attached to that piece of equipment for the rest of the scene.
Jury-Rig: You can use your intellect and crafting skills to create a temporary solution to a complex problem. You can spend a Plot Point to create a d8 Asset that represents a clever device, such as Improvised Blockade d8, Tripwire Trap d8, or Runic Distractor d8.
Field Repairs: You can use the Bolster move on a damaged object to remove a Complication from it. With a few minutes of work, you can mend a broken gate, a damaged weapon, or a disabled vehicle.

Path of the Unbreakable Wall: The Last Bastion
“They will not pass. Not while I still stand.”
This Path embodies your role as a protector. You become the ultimate defender, an immovable object of pure resilience, a "Struggler" in the truest Berserk fashion who endures impossible punishment. Your abilities are centered on absorbing damage, shielding your allies, and controlling the battlefield through sheer, unyielding presence. You are not the sword of your party; you are the shield, the wall, and the anchor.
Unbreakable Wall Talents:
Bodyguard: When an ally adjacent to you is the target of a Strike, you may choose to become the target instead. This does not require a Plot Point.
Hold the Line: You can spend a Plot Point when using the Maneuver move to create a Defensive Stance d8 Asset for yourself. While this Asset is active, enemies must succeed on an opposed roll to move past you.
Endure: When you take a Physical Stress or Complication die, you may step it down by one size. This is not a choice; you are simply built to last. This Talent is always active.

Talia: The Falconer
“The man who killed my mentor taught me a valuable lesson: the only person you can truly rely on is yourself. My hawk would agree, if he could talk.”
To play as Talia is to be defined by a singular, burning purpose. You were an orphan, a street rat with nothing to your name, until you were taken in by a master falconer. He was a retired soldier, a veteran of countless wars, and he saw in you a kindred spirit—a survivor with the sharp, predatory eyes of a hunter. He taught you everything he knew: how to live in the wild, how to track any prey, and how to command the magnificent birds of prey that were his only family. He became the father you never had.
And then he was murdered, cut down by a former comrade-in-arms over a forgotten grudge. You were there. You saw it all. Now, your life has been pared down to a single, brutal point: hunt down the man responsible and deliver the justice your mentor was denied. This is a classic, personal revenge quest, echoing the focused, character-driven stories of Legend of Mana and the harsh, unforgiving nature of a Berserk-style vendetta.
Signature Trait: Hunter's Bond This Trait represents your profound connection to your hawk companion, Zephyr. He is not a pet; he is an extension of your will, a partner in your hunt. This Trait covers your ability to communicate with him, your shared senses, and the flawless coordination you have in and out of combat.
Talia's Two Paths
Your life as a hunter with a singular purpose has given you a unique and deadly skillset. Do you focus on your own prowess as a peerless archer and tracker, or do you fully embrace your partnership with your hawk, becoming a two-person tactical team?
Path of the Sharpshooter: This Path focuses on your mastery of the bow. You are a peerless marksman, capable of making shots that others would deem impossible. Your abilities are centered on precision, range, and exploiting the weaknesses your hawk spots from above.
Path of the Falconer: This Path fully embraces your bond with Zephyr. He becomes a true partner in combat, not just a spotter. Your abilities are centered on coordinated strikes, harrying maneuvers, and a unique form of tandem fighting that makes you a formidable duo.
Talia's Paths: Sharpshooter or Falconer
As a hunter driven by a singular purpose, you must decide where your true strength lies. Do you hone your own peerless skill with the bow, becoming a deadly instrument of vengeance? Or do you deepen your partnership with your hawk, Zephyr, becoming a coordinated hunting team?

Path of the Sharpshooter: The Unseen Arrow
“The wind, the distance, the target’s heartbeat… I see it all. The arrow is just the final word in a conversation I’ve already finished.”
This Path focuses on your mastery of the bow, elevating you to the level of a legendary marksman. This is the path of the lone avenger, a direct reflection of the solitary, focused warrior archetype from Berserk. Your abilities are centered on precision, range, and exploiting the weaknesses that your hawk, Zephyr, spots from his vantage point in the sky.
Sharpshooter Talents:
Hawk's Eye: You do not suffer penalties for shooting at long range. You may spend a Plot Point to make a Strike roll against any target you can see, no matter how far away.
Called Shot: When Zephyr has an unobstructed view of your target, you can use the Debilitate move to target a specific point on your enemy. On a success, you create a debilitating Complication like Pinned Arm d8 or Hobbled Leg d8.
Ricochet Shot: You can spend a Plot Point to use Strike against an enemy who is in cover or out of your direct line of sight by ricocheting an arrow off a nearby surface.

Path of the Falconer: The Coordinated Hunt
“I am the eyes on the ground. He is the eyes in the sky. Together, we see everything.”
This Path fully embraces your bond with Zephyr, turning your partnership into a seamless tactical system. It is a philosophy of teamwork and synergy, reflecting the "found family" theme in a unique two-person unit. Your abilities are centered on coordinated strikes, harrying maneuvers, and a unique form of tandem fighting that makes you a formidable duo, reminiscent of the powerful companion systems in the Breath of Fire series.
Falconer Talents:
Harrier: You can use a Maneuver action to have Zephyr harry a target. This inflicts the Harried by Hawk d8 Complication on them, as he dives and claws, distracting them from their actions.
Coordinated Strike: When you inflict a Complication on a target, you may spend a Plot Point to have Zephyr immediately follow up with his own Strike, using your Hunter's Bond die as his dice pool.
Shared Senses: You can spend a Plot Point to see through Zephyr's eyes for an entire scene. This allows you to perceive your surroundings from a perfect aerial vantage point, making it impossible to ambush you and revealing hidden paths or dangers.
Sprout: The Grove Tender
“The forest… remembers. I am… its memory. But… I am not the forest. Who… am I?”
To play as Sprout is to be a mystery, even to yourself. You are a newly awakened Grove Tender, a being of wood and leaf and earth, born—or reborn—with no memory of a past life. You awoke in a sacred grove with only a single, overwhelming instinct: to protect the natural world from a creeping corruption you can feel in your very sap. You are powerful, your connection to the life force of Eryndor is absolute, but you are also a child in a world you do not understand.
Your journey is one of self-discovery, a quest for identity that is central to the melancholic and personal stories of Legend of Mana. Are you a spirit? A reborn mortal? A construct of the forest's dying will? You do not know. You are surrounded by a found family who treat you as a person, but you see the world in a fundamentally different way. The greatest danger you face is that in your quest to find your own identity, you may lose the very connection to the natural world that gives you your purpose.
Signature Trait: Heart of the Forest This Trait represents your absolute, instinctual connection to the life force of the natural world. It is the power that allows you to encourage explosive growth, to heal grievous wounds with a touch, and to communicate with the ancient, slumbering consciousness of the forest itself.
Sprout's Two Paths
Your power is the raw, untamed life force of Eryndor. Do you channel that power to become a nurturing healer, a mender of the broken land and its people? Or do you embrace its wild, untamable aspect, becoming a guardian who can transform the battlefield into a living, breathing weapon?
Path of the Nurturer: This Path focuses on the healing and restorative aspects of nature. Your abilities are centered on mending wounds, curing poisons and corruptions, and creating protective barriers of living wood and leaf.
Path of the Warden: This Path embraces the wild, defensive, and aggressive power of nature. You are not a gentle healer, but a fierce protector who can command roots to ensnare your foes and thorns to tear at their flesh, turning the environment into your ally.
Sprout's Paths: Nurturer or Warden
As a being of pure, raw life force, you must choose how to channel the forest's will. Do you embrace the gentle, restorative aspect of nature, becoming a mender of the broken land and its people? Or do you embody its fierce, protective instinct, becoming a guardian who can transform the battlefield into a living, breathing weapon?

Path of the Nurturer: The Mending Grove
“It hurts. I can… help it stop.”
This Path focuses on the healing and restorative aspects of nature. It is a philosophy of empathy and renewal, a direct reflection of the life-giving and community-healing themes found in both Breath of Fire and Legend of Mana. Your abilities are centered on mending wounds, curing poisons, and creating protective barriers of living wood and leaf. You are the gentle hand of the forest, closing wounds and encouraging new growth in the face of decay.
Nurturer Talents:
Verdant Touch: You can use the Bolster move to lay your hands on a creature and channel the life force of the earth. This removes a Physical Stress die, or a Complication related to poison or disease.
Wall of Thorns: You can spend a Plot Point when using Bolster to create a Living Barrier d8 Asset. This defensive wall of tangled, thorny vines can provide cover for your allies or block a path.
Purge Corruption: When you are in an area that has been blighted or corrupted by unnatural forces, you can spend a Plot Point and several minutes of concentration to use Bolster on the land itself, creating a Purified Ground d8 Asset that negates environmental Complications in that area.

Path of the Warden: The Vengeful Root
“You hurt the forest. The forest… will now hurt you.”
This Path embraces the wild, defensive, and aggressive power of nature. You are not a gentle gardener, but a fierce protector, a living embodiment of the forest's wrath. This is the grim, uncompromising side of nature from Berserk—the understanding that to protect life, you must often end a threat. You command roots to ensnare your foes and thorns to tear at their flesh, turning the environment itself into your ally and weapon.
Warden Talents:
Grasping Roots: When you use the Debilitate move, you can cause thick, thorny roots to erupt from the ground. On a success, you inflict the Ensnared d8 Complication on your target, holding them in place.
Nature's Wrath: When you are standing on natural earth or are in a forest, you may add a d6 to your dice pool for any Strike or Barrage roll, as the environment itself lends you its power.
One with the Wild: When you are in a forest or jungle, you can spend a Plot Point to use the Maneuver move to meld into a tree or patch of dense undergrowth, becoming Perfectly Hidden d10 until you choose to emerge.
Veridia: The Verdant Tempest
“I am the jungle. Its fury is my fury. Its roots are my bones. You are trespassing, and your trespass ends now.”
To play as Veridia is to be the living embodiment of nature's wrath. While Sprout represents the forest's memory and its instinct to nurture and protect, you are its raw, untamed power. You are not a person in the traditional sense; you are a force of nature given humanoid form, a living extension of the Serpent’s Maw Jungle's will to survive. You were awakened—or perhaps created—when a grave threat began to poison your home, and you now move through the world as an avatar of the jungle's fury.
Your journey is a primal and straightforward one, reflecting the raw, untamed forces of nature seen in Breath of Fire's dragon transformations and the overwhelming power of the apostles in Berserk. You do not understand the complexities of civilization, and you have little patience for politics or pleasantries. You see the world in simple terms: that which is part of the natural cycle, and that which is a blight that must be purged. Your challenge is to learn how to exist in a world outside your jungle home, and to see your new companions not as strange, fragile creatures, but as a new and unusual part of your ecosystem.
Signature Trait: Jungle's Wrath This Trait is your direct connection to the raw power of the Serpent's Maw. It is the fury of the thunderstorm, the crushing force of the flash flood, and the unyielding strength of the ancient trees. It allows you to channel the jungle's elemental rage into devastating attacks.
Veridia's Two Paths
As an avatar of the jungle, you can choose to channel its power in two distinct ways. Do you embody the explosive, unstoppable growth of the canopy, overwhelming your foes with sheer life force? Or do you become a conduit for the jungle's raw elemental fury, wielding storm, flood, and stone as your weapons?
Path of the Overgrowth: This Path focuses on the explosive, uncontrollable growth of the jungle. You become a walking cataclysm of nature, summoning massive vines to crush your enemies and transforming the battlefield into a hazardous, verdant maze.
Path of the Primal Elements: This Path channels the raw, untamed elements that rage within the jungle's heart. You are a living storm, calling down rain to create mudslides, summoning blasts of lightning from the humid canopy, and wielding the raw power of the land itself.
Veridia's Paths: Overgrowth or Primal Elements
As the living wrath of the Serpent's Maw, you must choose how to manifest your overwhelming natural power. Do you command the explosive, unstoppable growth of the jungle itself, turning the world into your weapon? Or do you unleash the raw elemental fury that storms beneath its canopy?

Path of the Overgrowth: The Unstoppable Bloom
“This world was green long before it was stone. I am here to remind it of that.”
This Path focuses on the explosive, uncontrollable growth of the jungle. It is a philosophy of overwhelming power, a reflection of the raw, world-altering forces seen in our core inspirations. You become a walking cataclysm of nature, summoning massive vines to crush your enemies and transforming the battlefield into a hazardous, verdant maze that only you can navigate.
Overgrowth Talents:
Unstable Growth: You can spend a Plot Point when using Barrage to cause a massive, explosive burst of plant life from the ground. Instead of inflicting Stress, you can reshape the battlefield, creating a Dense Jungle d8 Complication that provides cover but makes movement difficult for everyone but you.
Crushing Vines: When you use the Strike move, you can choose to summon thick, powerful vines to constrict your target. If you succeed, instead of inflicting Stress, you can inflict the Grappled by Vines d10 Complication.
One with the Green: When you are in a dense forest or jungle, you gain a d6 to all dice pools related to stealth or perception. The jungle is a part of you, and it alerts you to all intruders.

Path of the Primal Elements: The Monsoon Heart
“The jungle does not just grow. It floods. It storms. It breaks.”
This Path channels the raw, untamed elements that rage within the jungle's heart. You are a living storm, a walking monsoon. This Path is not the refined, focused power of a mage; it is the brutal, chaotic, and overwhelming force of a natural disaster, reflecting the awesome, terrifying power of nature from our core inspirations.
Primal Elements Talents:
Flash Flood: You can spend a Plot Point when using Debilitate in a jungle or rainy environment to summon a torrent of water and mud. On a success, you inflict the Mudslide d8 Complication on an entire zone, making it difficult terrain for everyone but you.
Canopy Lightning: When you use the Strike move in a humid or stormy environment, you can call a bolt of lightning down upon your foe. If you succeed, you may inflict the Dazed d6 Complication in addition to any Stress, as the thunderous crack deafens your target.
Living Current: You can use the Maneuver move to command a nearby source of water (a river, a large puddle, or even a magical torrent) to carry you or an ally. This allows you to move with unnatural speed across the battlefield for one turn.

Rune: The Living Ruin
“My creator is gone. My purpose is… fragmented. These memories are not mine, but they are all I have left of him.”
To play as Rune is to be a relic of a bygone age, a being of steel and stone animated by fading memories. You are a golem, a masterwork of artifice created by a brilliant Runeforge smith. You were designed to be a guardian, a protector, a living library of your creator's knowledge. But the Runeforge was destroyed, and your master was killed. You were left dormant for decades, your internal memory crystals shattered.
When you were recently reawakened, you found your own consciousness was a fractured mosaic of your creator's memories, emotions, and skills. You are not him, but you carry the echoes of his life within you. This creates a unique and melancholic journey of self-discovery, similar to the fragmented storytelling of Legend of Mana, where the past is a tangible, living force. Your quest is to find out who you are meant to be now that your original purpose is gone, and to piece together the fragmented memories within you to honor the man who gave you life.
Signature Trait: Fragmented Memories This Trait represents the fractured echoes of your creator's mind stored within your runic core. It is a chaotic library of knowledge, skills, and emotions. By focusing, you can draw upon these fragments to access skills and insights you don't rightfully possess, but the process is unpredictable and can sometimes be emotionally overwhelming.
Rune's Two Paths
Your very being is a collection of modular, fragmented parts. Do you focus on your physical form, reconfiguring your body to be the ultimate guardian your creator intended? Or do you delve into the chaotic memories in your mind, becoming a surprisingly versatile savant who can pull the right skill for any situation out of the ether?
Path of the Guardian: This Path focuses on reconfiguring your physical golem body. You can modify your limbs, reinforce your chassis, and deploy a variety of built-in defensive and offensive systems, becoming a master of battlefield adaptation.
Path of the Savant: This Path delves into the fragmented memories of your creator. You temporarily access his skills, becoming a jack-of-all-trades who can be a capable fighter one moment, a knowledgeable scholar the next, and a master artisan the moment after that.
Rune's Paths: Guardian or Savant
As a living construct with a fractured consciousness, you must choose where to focus your efforts. Do you concentrate on upgrading your physical form, becoming the ultimate protector your creator envisioned? Or do you delve into the chaotic memories within your core, becoming a versatile savant who can channel your creator's genius?

Path of the Guardian: The Modular Chassis
“This body is a fortress. And I am always making improvements.”
This Path focuses on reconfiguring your physical golem body. It is a philosophy of adaptation and physical perfection, a direct reflection of your creator's genius as a smith. You are a walking piece of masterwork artifice, capable of modifying your limbs, reinforcing your chassis, and deploying a variety of built-in systems. This Path is designed to be customized over the course of the campaign through the discovery of lost Runeforge Blueprints.
Guardian Talents:
Modular Chassis: Your golem body has three Modification Slots: Core, Arms, and Legs. You begin with a default modification in each slot. Over the course of your adventures, you may discover lost Runeforge Blueprints. During a period of rest, you can spend time and resources to install a new blueprint, replacing an existing modification and gaining a new Talent.
Default Mod—Aegis Plating (Core Slot): Your masterwork chassis is incredibly resilient. When you take Physical Stress, you may step it down by one size.
Default Mod—Piston Driver (Arm Slot): Your fists strike with the force of a smith's hammer. When you use the Strike move, you can choose to create a Staggered d6 Complication on your target in addition to any Stress.
Default Mod—Grounded Stance (Leg Slot): Your weighted legs make you an immovable anchor. You are immune to any effect that would forcibly move you or knock you prone, as long as you are on solid ground.

Path of the Savant: The Echoing Mind
“I remember… how to do that. I don’t know how I remember, but I do.”
This Path delves into the fragmented memories of your creator. It is a path of unexpected genius and profound melancholy, as you channel the ghost of another man's life. You temporarily access his skills, becoming a jack-of-all-trades who can be a capable fighter one moment, a knowledgeable scholar the next, and a master artisan the moment after that. This versatility comes from the sorrowful wellspring of a life that is not your own, a core theme from Legend of Mana.
Savant Talents:
A Glimpse of Genius: You can spend a Plot Point to add your Fragmented Memories die to any dice pool for a skill-based action, even if you are not trained in that skill. For a moment, you perfectly recall your creator's expertise.
Cryptic Flashback: Once per scene, you can ask the GM a single, specific question about your immediate surroundings or a piece of ancient technology. The GM will provide a truthful answer in the form of a cryptic, fragmented memory from your creator's past.
Emotional Overload: When you take Mental Stress, you are flooded with the painful memories of your creator's death. You may spend a Plot Point to channel this anguish outward, inflicting a d6 Mental Stress die on every enemy who can see you.

Zykar: The Soul-Bound Aegis
“My orders were to protect. My creator is gone, but the orders remain. This soul within me… is this a flaw in my design? Or is it a new directive?”
To play as Zykar is to be a ghost in the machine. You are a hulking golem of black iron, a marvel of Runeforge artifice, created for a single purpose: to serve as the unstoppable bodyguard for a master artisan. You were a perfect machine, loyal and unquestioning. But during the fall of the Runeforge, a fragment of a human soul—perhaps your creator's, perhaps a bystander's—was accidentally fused with your runic core during a catastrophic magical explosion.
Now, you are no longer a simple automaton. You are a conflicted, nascent consciousness trapped within a powerful war machine. You are driven by your original directive to protect, but this new, fragmented soul bombards you with unfamiliar emotions: fear, loyalty, and a dawning sense of self. This internal conflict between programming and a developing soul is a direct reflection of the Berserk struggle between fate/destiny and free will. Your journey is to reconcile these two opposing forces and decide for yourself what it truly means to "protect."
Signature Trait: Guardian Protocol This Trait represents your core programming as an elite bodyguard. It grants you an instinctual understanding of threat assessment, defensive tactics, and unwavering loyalty. It is the source of your resilience and your single-minded focus in combat, but it can also make it difficult for you to act outside the parameters of your original design.
Zykar's Two Paths
Your existence is a fusion of flawless design and a flawed, human element. Do you lean into your original programming, becoming the perfect, emotionless bodyguard? Or do you embrace the chaotic, unpredictable soul within you, unlocking a new and more human way of fighting?
Path of the Aegis: This Path focuses on your core programming as the ultimate bodyguard. Your abilities are centered on threat neutralization, damage mitigation, and unwavering defense of a designated "warden" (one of your allies).
Path of the Awakened Soul: This Path channels the unpredictable human soul fused with your core. This power is more chaotic, granting you the ability to push your mechanical body past its design limits and act with a creativity and ferocity that no machine should possess.
Zykar's Paths: Aegis or Awakened Soul
As a being caught between perfect programming and a flawed, human soul, you must choose which aspect to channel. Do you embrace the flawless logic of your original design, becoming the perfect bodyguard? Or do you tap into the chaotic, emotional power of the soul within, becoming something new and unpredictable?

Path of the Aegis: The Unbroken Protocol
“Threat identified. Probability of mission success: 100%. Executing… Protection.”
This Path focuses on your core programming as the ultimate bodyguard. It is the philosophy of perfect, logical defense, a machine built to protect. This reflects the unyielding, purpose-built nature of powerful constructs and golems from classic JRPGs. Your abilities are centered on threat neutralization, damage mitigation, and an unwavering, almost dispassionate defense of your chosen allies. You are a shield, pure and simple.
Aegis Talents:
Warden Protocol: At the start of a scene, you may designate one ally as your "Warden." You may add a d6 to any dice pool for an action that directly involves protecting that specific ally from harm.
Threat Intercept: You can use the Maneuver move to immediately place yourself between your Warden and an enemy who is about to attack them. You become the target of that attack instead.
Calculated Defense: When you use the Bolster move to defend yourself, you can spend a Plot Point to analyze your opponent's fighting style. Create a Defensive Matrix d8 Asset that can be used against any attack from that specific enemy for the rest of the scene.

Path of the Awakened Soul: The Ghost in the Machine
“My gears grind. My chassis aches. But this… feeling… it tells me to fight harder. To protect them all.”
This Path channels the unpredictable human soul fused with your core. This power is more chaotic, a direct reflection of the Berserk theme of humanity and emotion (even rage) being a source of unpredictable, incredible strength. You push your mechanical body past its design limits, acting with a creativity and ferocity that no machine should possess. This Path is more powerful, but it also opens you up to the uniquely human vulnerability of emotional and mental trauma.
Awakened Soul Talents:
Overdrive: You can spend a Plot Point to push your systems past their limits. Step up any one die in your dice pool by one size for a single roll. If you do, you must take the System Strain d6 Complication as your body struggles to handle the overload.
Loyalty Surge: When an ally you can see is defeated or taken out of a scene, you are flooded with a protective, emotional surge. You may immediately remove a d8 Physical Stress die from yourself and gain a Vengeful Fury d8 Asset for your next action.
Adaptive Tactics: You can spend a Plot Point to create an Asset that reflects a sudden, creative, and very un-machine-like solution to a problem, such as Improvised Projectile d8 or Unexpected Feint d8.


Eldra: The Oracle
“History is not written by the victors. It is written by those who survive. I survived. And I remember the truth.”
To play as Eldra is to be a living memory, a ghost bound to the world by an oath to preserve the truth. You were once a powerful oracle, a high priestess who could read the currents of fate. You stood with the Dragon Lords and their allies during the Shattering, and you were there when the grand betrayal occurred. You died that day, but your spirit refused to pass on. You became a ghostly remnant, a spectral witness bound to the mortal plane with a singular, solemn purpose: to ensure the true history of the Shattering is not forgotten, and to guide those who have the strength to correct it.
Your existence is one of melancholic observation, a direct reflection of the themes of fragmented memory and sad, beautiful history from Legend of Mana. You are a being of immense knowledge, but you are intangible, unable to directly interact with the world you so desperately wish to protect. You rely on your found family to be your hands, your voice, and your sword. The greatest danger you face is fading entirely, your purpose unfulfilled, as the world forgets the truths you died to protect.
Signature Trait: Echoes of the Shattering This Trait represents your ghostly nature and your profound connection to the past. It is the source of your prophetic visions and your ability to interact with the spiritual echoes that linger in the world. It allows you to perceive truths that are hidden from mortal eyes, but it also constantly bombards you with the traumatic memories of the world's greatest tragedy.
Eldra's Two Paths
As a spectral witness to history, you can choose to focus your power in two distinct ways. Do you embrace your role as a prophet, looking forward to guide your allies through the treacherous currents of fate? Or do you embrace your role as a historian, looking backward to draw power and knowledge from the ghosts and memories of the past?
Path of the Oracle: This Path focuses on your precognitive abilities. You are a reader of signs and portents, a prophet who can glimpse possible futures and warn your allies of impending dangers or opportunities.
Path of the Spiritualist: This Path delves into your connection with the lingering spirits of the dead. You can communicate with ghosts, manifest spectral objects, and draw on the ambient emotional energy of a location to aid you.
Eldra's Paths: Oracle or Spiritualist
As a spirit bound to the truth, you must choose how to focus your unique perception. Do you look forward, into the tangled skeins of the future, to guide your companions away from disaster? Or do you look backward, to the echoes and ghosts of the past, drawing knowledge and power from those who came before?

Path of the Oracle: The Unveiled Future
“The future is not a straight line. It is a storm, and I am the only one who can see the lightning before it strikes.”
This Path focuses on your precognitive abilities. It is a philosophy of foresight and guidance, a reflection of the classic JRPG trope of the prophet who aids the heroes on their quest. You become a reader of signs and portents, a reluctant prophet who can glimpse possible futures and warn your allies of impending dangers or hidden opportunities. This power is a heavy burden, as you often see tragedies you are powerless to prevent directly.
Oracle Talents:
Portent: At the start of a scene, you may ask the GM a single "what is the greatest danger here?" question. The GM must give you a truthful, though perhaps cryptic, answer based on your visions.
Fated Intervention: You can spend a Plot Point to use Bolster, granting an ally a flash of insight. This creates a Precognitive Dodge d8 Asset they can use to defend against one attack this scene.
Pathfinder: When the party is faced with a choice of paths or a complex decision with unknown consequences, you may spend a Plot in Point to use Maneuver to "scry" the options. The GM will tell you which path holds the most immediate danger and which seems the safest.

Path of the Spiritualist: The Whispering Past
“The dead are not silent. You have just forgotten how to listen. I have not forgotten.”
This Path delves into your connection with the lingering spirits of the dead. It is a philosophy of history and memory, drawing on the melancholic, ghost-filled world of Legend of Mana. You do not just see the past; you can interact with it. You can communicate with ghosts, manifest spectral objects, and draw on the ambient emotional energy of a location to aid your allies and hinder your foes.
Spiritualist Talents:
Speak with Echoes: You can communicate with the lingering spiritual echoes of the recently deceased. You may spend a Plot Point to ask the spirit of a dead creature three simple, direct questions, which it must answer truthfully as best it can.
Manifestation: You can use the Debilitate move to channel the sorrow or anger of a location's spirits. On a success, you inflict the Ghostly Chains d8 Complication on a target, as spectral hands reach out to hold them in place.
Grave Chill: When you are in a location with a strong connection to death or tragedy (a graveyard, a battlefield, a ruin), you may add a d6 to any dice pool that channels the location's spiritual energy.

Era: The Scrivener
“Every creature has a story to tell. Every claw, every scale, every roar is a word in that story. I am here to learn the language.”
To play as Era is to be driven by an insatiable, academic curiosity. You are a Scrivener from the Astoran Republic, a nation that values knowledge and innovation above all else. While your peers studied history or artifice, you were fascinated by the natural world, specifically the unique biological and magical abilities of Eryndor’s diverse fauna. You became a pioneer in the field of "Resonant Adaptation," a magical art that allows you to temporarily replicate the physical and magical traits of creatures you have studied.
Your journey is one of discovery and scholarship, a direct reflection of the JRPG trope of the scholar or researcher who joins the heroes to complete their life's work. You have come to the wilds of Eryndor to create the ultimate bestiary, a "Creature Codex" that doesn't just describe its subjects, but perfectly replicates their powers. You are not a warrior by trade, but your unique abilities make you a surprisingly versatile and unpredictable ally. Your greatest challenge is your academic detachment; you sometimes see your allies and their struggles as just another fascinating entry for your codex, and you must learn to see the world not just as a thing to be studied, but as a home to be protected.
Signature Trait: Creature Codex This Trait represents your unique magical art and the ever-growing bestiary you keep. It is the source of your ability to analyze and replicate the traits of other creatures. The more diverse the creatures you encounter and study, the more powerful and versatile your own abilities become.
Era's Two Paths
Your unique magic allows you to adapt to any situation by borrowing from the natural world. Do you focus on replicating the powerful offensive abilities of Eryndor’s greatest predators? Or do you embrace the subtle and stranger defensive and support abilities of its most resilient creatures?
Path of the Predator: This Path focuses on replicating the deadly offensive traits of the creatures you study. You can manifest the claws of a great beast, the venom of a serpent, or the fiery breath of a lesser drake, becoming a surprisingly effective front-line combatant.
Path of the Survivor: This Path focuses on replicating the clever and resilient defensive and support abilities of Eryndor's fauna. You can manifest the armored shell of a great tortoise, the regenerative abilities of a troll, or the camouflage of a chameleon, becoming a master of support and survival.
Dragon Legacy: Core Rulebook - Batch 37
Era's Paths: Predator or Survivor
As a researcher driven by a quest for knowledge, you must choose how to apply your unique adaptive magic. Do you focus on replicating the deadly, offensive abilities of Eryndor's apex predators to end threats quickly? Or do you embrace the clever, resilient, and often bizarre survival traits of its most enduring creatures?

Path of the Predator: The Red in Tooth and Claw
“Observation is not enough. To truly understand a creature, you must hunt as it hunts.”
This Path focuses on replicating the deadly offensive traits of the creatures you have studied and documented in your codex. It is a philosophy of aggressive adaptation, reflecting the raw, often brutal, power of the natural world seen in both Berserk's monstrous apostles and the draconic transformations of Breath of Fire. You manifest the claws of a great beast, the venom of a serpent, or the fiery breath of a lesser drake, becoming a surprisingly ferocious and effective combatant.
Predator Talents:
Apex Adaptation: At the start of a scene, you may spend a Plot Point to study your surroundings and choose one creature you have previously documented. Create a d8 Asset that mimics one of its core offensive abilities, such as Gryphon's Talons d8, Wyvern's Sting d8, or Basalt Lizard's Fiery Spit d8. This Asset can be used with your Strike or Barrage moves.
Hunter's Ferocity: When you use an Asset created by Apex Adaptation, you may step up the Effect die. If you do, you must take the Primal Urges d6 Mental Complication as the creature's instincts momentarily cloud your academic judgment.
Anatomical Weakness: When you succeed on a Strike roll against a creature you have documented in your codex, you may spend a Plot Point to add a Complication equal to your Effect die, representing a precise strike against a known weak point.

Path of the Survivor: The Unending Adaptation
“It is not the strongest species that survives, nor the most intelligent; it is the one most adaptable to change.”
This Path focuses on replicating the clever, resilient, and often bizarre defensive and support abilities of Eryndor's fauna. This is a philosophy of survival and utility, inspired by the incredible diversity of life and the unique, often whimsical solutions to problems found in the world of Legend of Mana. You manifest the armored shell of a great tortoise, the regenerative abilities of a troll, or the camouflage of a chameleon, becoming a master of support and battlefield control.
Survivor Talents:
Resilient Adaptation: At the start of a scene, you may spend a Plot Point to study your surroundings and choose one creature you have previously documented. Create a d8 Asset that mimics one of its core defensive or support abilities, such as Tortoise's Shell d8 (defense), Troll's Blood d8 (regeneration), or Chameleon's Hide d8 (stealth).
Perfect Camouflage: If you have replicated a creature's stealth or camouflage ability, you can spend a Plot Point when using the Maneuver move to grant yourself and any adjacent allies the Hidden d8 Asset for one turn.
Symbiotic Support: You can use the Bolster move to grant an ally a temporary, minor biological enhancement. This could be removing a poison Complication by replicating a serpent's antivenom, or granting the Amphibious d6 Asset for a short time by mimicking a giant frog.



Chapter 4: The Game Moderator - Weaving the Tapestry of Fate
This chapter is for the Game Moderator (GM), the storyteller and rules arbiter for Dragon Legacy. While this game is designed to be run smoothly by an AI, a human GM can use these same principles to craft a compelling and challenging experience. Your role is not to be an adversary to the players, but to be a conduit for the world of Eryndor. You present challenges, embody the world's characters, and, most importantly, help the players tell a story of fatalistic hope.
Your Guiding Principles
Everything you do as the GM should be filtered through the core themes we have established:
Embody the Lie: The world is built on a grand betrayal. The Champions of Order are not cartoonishly evil; they are true believers in a false history. Present their "perfect order" as a genuinely tempting, if soulless, alternative to the chaotic, painful world the heroes inhabit.
Highlight the Cost of Power: The heroes are powerful, but that power is a curse. When they tap into their inner strength (Rya's Inner Dragon, Zael's Whisperer, Garrick's Vengeance), remind them of the cost. Inflict Complications that reflect this struggle. Describe the physical and mental toll their abilities take. Scars—physical and emotional—should be a tangible part of the story.
Nurture the Found Family: The only true shield against the darkness is the bond between the heroes. Create scenarios that test their loyalty, force them to rely on one another, and celebrate their victories as a group. A hero alone is a tragedy waiting to happen; a hero with their found family is a flicker of hope.
Paint a Melancholic World: Eryndor is beautiful but sad. Describe the world through the lens of Legend of Mana. Ruins should be majestic but lonely. Forests should be ancient but feel like they are sleeping. Cities should be bustling but with an undercurrent of quiet desperation. Let the world itself be a character with a tragic, beautiful story to tell.
Setting Difficulties
The core mechanic is simple, and so is setting the difficulty for a task. The players' Total on a roll must meet or beat a Difficulty number. Use the following as a guideline:
Easy (Difficulty 8): A routine task with a minor chance of failure. Leaping a small gap or intimidating a cowardly guard.
Standard (Difficulty 10): A challenging task for a skilled individual. Climbing a treacherous cliff or persuading a skeptical merchant. This should be your default for most actions.
Hard (Difficulty 12): A truly difficult task that pushes the limits of the heroes' abilities. Deciphering a complex ancient text or holding a collapsing temple roof.
Heroic (Difficulty 14+): A near-impossible task that will require teamwork, Plot Points, and a truly great roll to succeed. Calming the heart of an enraged dragon or standing against the First Champion himself.Your Tools - Complications and Stress
As the GM, your primary tools for driving the narrative and creating challenges are Complications and Stress. These are not just ways to hinder the players; they are narrative prompts that make the world feel alive and reactive. Using them effectively is key to creating the tone of "Fatalistic Hope."
1. Complications: The Shifting World
A Complication is a temporary, situational obstacle with a die rating. It’s a problem that makes a task harder or introduces a new challenge to a scene. You can introduce Complications in several ways:
On a Failed Roll: When a player’s Total fails to meet the Difficulty, the simplest outcome is that their action fails. A more interesting outcome is that they succeed, but with a Complication. Let them get what they want, but add a new problem.
"You manage to leap the chasm (you hit the Total), but you land awkwardly. You take a Twisted Ankle d8 Complication. You’re across, but you’ll be slower for a while."
As a GM Action: You can spend a Plot Point from your own pool to introduce a Complication at any time, reflecting the changing environment or the enemy's tactics.
"The bandit leader sees you focusing on him and kicks over a brazier. The whole room is suddenly filled with a Blinding Smoke d8 Complication."
From an Enemy's Effect Die: When an NPC succeeds on a roll against a player, their Effect die can be used to create a Complication.
"The golem's slam attack misses, but its Effect die is a d10. The floor cracks under the blow, creating Unstable Rubble d10 all around you."
Complications are overcome when the players use an action to deal with them directly. A Burning Room d8 can be put out, or a Pinned d6 can be struggled out of.
2. Stress: The Weight of the Struggle
Stress is a special type of Complication that is applied directly to a character, representing physical, mental, or even emotional harm. Instead of tracking hit points, characters have Stress Tracks. In Dragon Legacy, we use three:
Physical Stress: Wounds, exhaustion, poison.
Mental Stress: Fear, confusion, despair.
Draconic Stress (Rya Only): The corrupting influence of the Inner Dragon.
When a character is hit by an attack, the attacker’s Effect die becomes a Stress die. For example, a solid hit might inflict Physical Stress d8.
Escalation: If a character takes Stress of a type they already have, the die size increases. A d8 Stress that is hit with another d8 Stress becomes a d10 Stress.
Taken Out: If any Stress die is ever increased beyond a d12, the character is Taken Out. They are not necessarily dead, but they are removed from the scene—knocked unconscious, mentally broken, or having fled in terror.
Using Stress makes harm a narrative event. It's not just losing points; it's a growing problem (Exhausted d6 -> Exhausted d8) that has a direct mechanical and story impact, perfectly reflecting the "Cost of Power" theme.
Structuring the Narrative
As the GM, you are the director of the story, but the players are the stars. Your goal is to create a structure that allows their personal stories to shine while still moving the main plot forward. We will borrow heavily from the narrative style of Legend of Mana, focusing on character-centric "events" rather than a single, linear quest line.
1. Scenes: The Building Blocks
A Scene is a single, continuous block of time where the characters are in one location dealing with a specific situation. It can be a tense negotiation, a frantic chase, or a quiet moment of reflection between two heroes.
Establish the Stakes: Every scene should have a purpose. Before it begins, ask yourself: What is the goal of the heroes in this scene? What is the primary obstacle? What could go wrong?
Use Your Tools: This is where you use Complications and Stress to make the scene dynamic. A simple conversation becomes tense when you introduce a Suspicious Guard d8 Complication. A fight becomes desperate when a hero takes Exhaustion d10 Stress.
End with a Change: A scene should always end with the situation having changed in some meaningful way. The heroes get the information they need, an enemy escapes, a new clue is discovered, or an important decision is made.
2. Events: The Character-Driven Stories
An Event is a mini-story arc, typically lasting one to three sessions, that focuses on a specific character's personal quest or a contained, local problem. This is the core of the Dragon Legacy experience. Instead of a single, epic "main quest," the campaign is built from these smaller, more intimate Events.
Center it on a Hero: Frame each Event around one of the 15 heroes and their personal struggles. An Event might be "Selra Confronts Her Past," where the party travels to a town from her former life, or "Kei Hunts the Beast," a quest to track a monster that is terrorizing his ancestral lands.
Weave in the Main Plot: While the Event is personal, it should still connect to the larger conflict. The beast Kei is hunting might have been corrupted by the Brood of Dragnor. The figure from Selra's past might now be a high-ranking Champion of Order. This makes the grand, epic struggle feel personal and grounded.
Embrace the Melancholy: Not every Event needs a happy ending. This is a world of fatalistic hope. Sometimes, victory is bittersweet. The heroes might save the town but fail to save their friend. They might defeat the monster but learn a terrible truth in the process. These melancholic notes, inspired by Legend of Mana, make the moments of true, unambiguous victory all the more powerful.
By structuring your campaign as a series of interconnected, character-focused Events, you create a rich and personal tapestry of stories. The players will feel like the main plot is happening because of their personal journeys, not in spite of them. This is the essence of a true legacy.
Running the World - Combat and Characters
As the GM, your role extends beyond simply presenting challenges. You breathe life into the world, giving a voice to its inhabitants and a sense of weight and consequence to its conflicts. This section provides guidance on running combat and embodying the characters of Eryndor.
1. The Art of Combat: Brutal and Consequential
Combat in Dragon Legacy should never be a simple, clean exchange of blows. It is a desperate, messy, and narrative-driven struggle for survival, a direct reflection of the brutal world of Berserk. Every fight should feel like it has stakes beyond mere victory or defeat.
It's a Story, Not a Simulation: Your primary goal in combat is to tell a compelling story. Use descriptive language. When a hero takes Stress, describe the impact—the cracking of armor, the grunt of pain, the flicker of fear in their eyes. When an enemy is defeated, describe their fall in a way that reflects their nature.
The World is a Weapon: The environment is a third combatant in every fight. A battle in a tavern should involve thrown mugs and overturned tables (Cluttered Room d8 Complication). A fight on a cliff edge should always carry the risk of a fall (Sheer Drop d10 Complication). Encourage players to use the environment, and have your enemies do the same.
Enemies Have Goals: Enemies rarely fight to the death for no reason. A hungry beast might flee if it's badly wounded. A bandit might surrender if their leader is taken down. A Champion of Order might try to capture the heroes rather than kill them. Give your NPCs believable goals beyond "kill the players." This makes them feel like real characters and creates more interesting outcomes than a simple total party kill.
2. Embodying the People of Eryndor: A World of Strugglers
Every character the heroes meet, from a humble farmer to the First Champion himself, is a product of this broken world. They are all, in their own way, "strugglers."
Allies and Villagers: These are the people the heroes are fighting for. They are the heart of the "found family" theme. Give them names, families, and simple, personal problems. A farmer isn't worried about the grand betrayal; he's worried about a blight on his crops. A blacksmith isn't concerned with the Champions of Order; she's concerned about a protection racket run by local thugs. By helping these people with their small, personal stories (Legend of Mana style), the heroes build a tangible connection to the world and are reminded of what they are fighting to protect.
Antagonists are Not Evil; They are Certain: Your primary villains, the Champions of Order, should never be portrayed as cackling monsters. They are true believers. They genuinely think that free will is a flaw and that their silent, perfect order is a gift that will end all suffering. They are tragic, misguided, and utterly convinced of their own righteousness. The horror of the Champions is not in their malice, but in their certainty. They offer a paradise that is a cage, and they cannot understand why anyone would refuse it.
Running the World - Combat and Characters
As the GM, you are the director of the story, but the players are the stars. Your goal is to create a structure that allows their personal stories to shine while still moving the main plot forward. This section provides guidance on running combat and embodying the characters of Eryndor.
1. Embodying the Villains of Eryndor: A Spectrum of Malice
The antagonists the heroes face should be as deep and varied as the heroes themselves. Not every villain is a monster, and not every monster is a misguided soul. To create a truly compelling world, you must embrace a spectrum of villainy.
The Certain (Tragic Villains): This archetype is embodied by the Champions of Order. These are not cackling, mustache-twirling villains; they are true believers who are utterly convinced of their own righteousness. They genuinely believe that free will is a flaw and that their silent, perfect order is a gift that will end all suffering. The horror of the Champions is not in their malice, but in their absolute, terrifying certainty. They are the tragic figures who would burn the world down to build their paradise.
The Corrupted (Monstrous Villains): This is where you find true, unadulterated evil. The Brood of Dragnor and other such entities fall into this category. These are individuals who, like the apostles of Berserk, have sacrificed their humanity for power. They have embraced their inner monster and now revel in cruelty, destruction, and chaos. They are not misguided; they are malevolent. They enjoy the suffering they cause and see it as an expression of their strength. These are the characters who can be, as you say, "straight evil."
The Ambitious (Pragmatic Villains): Factions like the Arcane Dominion represent a third, more insidious kind of evil. They are not driven by faith or monstrous hunger, but by a cold, amoral pragmatism. They see people, magic, and the world itself as resources to be consumed in their endless quest for knowledge and power. They are not necessarily cruel for cruelty's sake, but they will commit any atrocity without hesitation if it serves their goals. Their evil is the chilling emptiness of ambition without empathy.
2. The Art of Combat: Brutal and Consequential
Combat in Dragon Legacy should never be a simple, clean exchange of blows. It is a desperate, messy, and narrative-driven struggle for survival.
It's a Story, Not a Simulation: Your primary goal in combat is to tell a compelling story. Use descriptive language. When a hero takes Stress, describe the impact—the cracking of armor, the grunt of pain, the flicker of fear in their eyes.
The World is a Weapon: The environment is a third combatant. A battle in a tavern should involve thrown mugs and overturned tables. A fight on a cliff edge should always carry the risk of a fall.
Enemies Have Goals: A Corrupted monster might fight to the death, but an Ambitious mercenary will likely flee or surrender if the odds turn against them. Give your NPCs believable goals beyond "kill the players."
3. Allies and Villagers: The Heart of the World
These are the people the heroes are fighting for. Give them names, families, and simple, personal problems. By helping these people with their small, Legend of Mana-style stories, the heroes build a tangible connection to the world and are reminded of what they are fighting to protect.

Chapter 5: Bestiary - The Fauna of a Broken World
This chapter provides the Game Moderator with a selection of the creatures and antagonists that inhabit the world of Eryndor. The fauna of this land is as scarred and strange as its history. Many creatures are natural animals that have adapted to the harsh realities of the Age of Scars, while others are twisted abominations created by the magical fallout of the Shattering or the deliberate, cruel machinations of factions like the Brood of Dragnor.
Each entry in this bestiary is designed for ease of use, providing a narrative hook and a simple mechanical profile.
Understanding the Stat Block
Name & Description: A brief, evocative description of the creature and its typical behavior.
Rank: The creature's overall power level, from 1 (Novice) to 8 (Mythic). The Rank die is often included in the creature's dice pools.
Traits: A few key descriptive keywords that define the creature's core nature. These can be used to add dice to a pool or as narrative permissions for certain actions.
Stress Track: The size of the creature's Physical Stress die. When it takes Stress greater than this die size, it is taken out.
Standard Dice Pool: A pre-calculated dice pool for the creature's most common actions, making it fast and easy for the GM to use in a fight.

Brood of Dragnor
These creatures are not natural. They are the fanatical foot soldiers and monstrous war beasts of the Brood of Dragnor, a nihilistic cult that worships the destructive power of dragons. They are often augmented with crude, painful-looking armor and infused with a sliver of unstable draconic energy.
Dragnor Acolyte
A wild-eyed fanatic, draped in scorched robes and wielding a crudely forged, saw-toothed blade. They fight with a reckless disregard for their own life, driven by the promises of their Ashen Priest.
Rank: 2 (Adept)
Traits: Fanatical, Reckless, Expendable
Stress Track: Physical Stress d6
Standard Dice Pool (Saw-Toothed Blade): Rank d8 + Fanatical d8
Effect: Acolytes typically inflict Physical Stress or create Complications like Pinned by Numbers d6.
Cinderclaw Bear
A great bear, its hide covered in sizzling, runic scars and its claws fused with jagged, superheated obsidian. It is a living engine of destruction, a beast captured and twisted by the Brood's dark magic into a creature of pure, unthinking rage.
Rank: 4 (Elite)
Traits: Twisted War Beast, Superheated Claws, Unstoppable Rage
Stress Track: Physical Stress d10
Standard Dice Pool (Cinder Claws): Rank d10 + Unstoppable Rage d8 + Strength d10
Effect: Cinderclaws are designed to cause massive physical harm. Their Effect die inflicts Physical Stress. On a successful hit, they can also inflict a Burning Wound d6 Complication.
Special: Terrifying Roar: As an action, the Cinderclaw can unleash a terrifying roar. All heroes who can hear it must make a Spirit roll against a Difficulty of 10 or take a Frightened d8 Mental Stress die.

Wildlife of Eryndor
Not all threats are the result of a cult's machinations. The wilds of Eryndor are dangerous and untamed, home to predators that have adapted to the harsh, magic-scarred landscape in unique and deadly ways.
Gravewood Wolf
A large, unnaturally intelligent wolf with mottled grey-and-black fur that allows it to blend perfectly into the shadows of Eryndor’s ancient, petrified forests. They are pack hunters, known for their eerie, silent coordination.
Rank: 2 (Adept)
Traits: Pack Hunter, Silent Stalker, Supernatural Senses
Stress Track: Physical Stress d8
Standard Dice Pool (Vicious Bite): Rank d8 + Agility d8
Effect: Gravewood Wolves inflict Physical Stress.
Special: Pack Tactics: For every other Gravewood Wolf adjacent to its target, this wolf adds a d6 to its attack dice pool.
Champions of Order
The Champions of Order are not a single race, but a disciplined military order bound by a singular, fanatical faith: the belief that the goddess Elysia will return to cleanse the world of chaos and usher in an age of perfect, silent order. They are well-trained, well-equipped, and utterly convinced of their own righteousness.
Elysian Zealot
The rank-and-file soldier of the Champions of Order. Clad in polished steel armor and wielding a spear and shield, the Zealot is a highly disciplined and dangerous opponent. They are not a mindless fanatic, but a true believer who fights with coordinated, tactical precision.
Rank: 2 (Adept)
Traits: Disciplined, Shield Wall, Unwavering Faith
Stress Track: Physical Stress d8
Standard Dice Pool (Spear Thrust): Rank d8 + Disciplined d8
Effect: Zealots are trained to neutralize threats. Their Effect die can inflict Physical Stress or create Complications like Pinned Down d6 or Off-Balance d6.
Special: Shield Wall: When this Zealot is adjacent to another Champion of Order, add a d6 to its defensive dice pools.

Knight of the Order
An elite, heavily armored warrior who serves as a field commander for the Champions. Knights of the Order are paragons of the Elysian faith, wielding massive greatswords or warhammers with terrifying skill. They are both inspiring leaders and formidable individual combatants.
Rank: 4 (Elite)
Traits: Elite Training, Inspiring Presence, Heavily Armored
Stress Track: Physical Stress d10
Standard Dice Pool (Greatsword): Rank d10 + Elite Training d8 + Strength d10
Effect: Knights inflict heavy Physical Stress. They can also use their Effect die to Sunder Armor d8, a Complication that can be applied to a hero's defensive equipment.
Special: Rallying Cry: Once per scene, as an action, a Knight can issue a rallying cry. All allied Zealots in the scene gain an Inspired d6 Asset for their next action.
Arcane Dominion
The Arcane Dominion is a sprawling magocracy that values knowledge and power above all else. Their ranks include brilliant scholars, ruthless magical researchers, and the arcane constructs they create to enforce their will. They are not driven by faith or fanaticism, but by a cold, amoral ambition to unlock every secret the universe has to offer, no matter the cost.
Runic Sentry
A floating construct of polished brass and pulsating crystals. Runic Sentries are semi-sentient automatons created to patrol the Dominion's laboratories and archives. They are eerily silent, communicating only in flashes of arcane light, and they enforce security protocols with cold, logical efficiency.
Rank: 3 (Veteran)
Traits: Arcane Construct, Silent Protector, Logical
Stress Track: Physical Stress d8
Standard Dice Pool (Arcane Bolt): Rank d8 + Logical d8 + SPC d8
Effect: Runic Sentries are designed for incapacitation. Their Effect die typically inflicts a Stunned d6 or Paralyzed d8 Complication rather than direct Stress.
Special: Alarm Protocol: If a Runic Sentry is damaged or detects a high-level threat, it can emit a piercing arcane shriek. This creates a Reinforcements on the Way d8 scene Complication.

Dominion Researcher
A high-ranking member of the Arcane Dominion, clad in enchanted robes and wielding a staff crackling with raw power. They are arrogant, brilliant, and utterly ruthless in their pursuit of knowledge. They view combat not as a brawl, but as a series of complex equations to be solved with the precise application of overwhelming force.
Rank: 5 (Champion)
Traits: Master of the Arcane, Arrogant, Glass Cannon
Stress Track: Physical Stress d6
Standard Dice Pool (Unstable Energy Burst): Rank d10 + Master of the Arcane d10 + SPC d12
Effect: Researchers wield immense power. Their Effect die inflicts heavy Physical or magical Stress.
Special: Counterspell: A Dominion Researcher can spend a Plot Point to attempt to counter a magical ability used by a hero. The Researcher rolls their Standard Dice Pool against the hero's roll. If the Researcher wins, the hero's ability fails.

Appendix A: Optional and Expanded Rules
This chapter contains a collection of optional subsystems and expanded rules that a Game Moderator can choose to incorporate into their Dragon Legacy campaign. These systems are designed to add more depth and complexity to specific aspects of the game, such as character progression, downtime activities, and world-building. While not necessary for the core experience, they can provide a richer, more detailed campaign for groups who desire it.

The Settlement System: Building a Home
Inspired by the town-building mechanics of Breath of Fire and the "Land Make" system of Legend of Mana, this subsystem allows the heroes to establish and develop a home base, a settlement that can grow and change over the course of the campaign. This provides the "found family" with a physical home to protect and a tangible representation of their progress in making the world a safer place.
1. Establishing a Settlement
The party can choose to establish a settlement in a suitable, cleared location. This could be the site of an old ruin, a strategically important crossroads, or simply a place of natural beauty. Once a location is chosen, the settlement begins at Rank 1.
2. Settlement Rank and Traits
A settlement has its own Rank, which represents its overall size, security, and influence. The Rank can be increased by completing major Events that benefit the settlement, investing resources, or recruiting skilled NPCs.
A settlement also has a set of Traits with die ratings, just like a character:
Prosperity (d4): Represents the settlement's economic health and resources.
Security (d4): Represents the settlement's defenses and the skill of its guards.
Community (d4): Represents the morale and unity of the settlers.
3. The Settlement Turn
Between major Events, the GM can run a "Settlement Turn." During this phase, players can choose to undertake projects to improve their settlement. This might involve:
Building Projects: Constructing new buildings like a forge, an infirmary, or a watchtower. Each building provides a bonus, such as stepping up one of the settlement's Trait dice.
Recruitment Missions: Undertaking short quests to recruit skilled NPCs (like a blacksmith, a healer, or a lore master) to come live in their settlement.
Community Events: Hosting a festival or resolving a dispute between settlers to raise the Community die.
As the settlement grows, it will attract more people, new plot hooks, and, inevitably, the unwanted attention of the party's enemies, making it both a valuable asset and a vulnerable target.

Appendix A (Continued): Optional and Expanded Rules

Learning from Masters: The Path of Growth
This optional subsystem provides a framework for heroes to grow beyond their initial abilities by seeking out and learning from unique masters scattered throughout the world of Eryndor. This is a classic JRPG trope, heavily inspired by the "Masters" system in Breath of Fire III, and it provides a strong incentive for exploration and roleplaying. It reinforces the idea that true strength is not just found within, but is also forged through connection and mentorship.
1. Finding a Master
Masters are unique, powerful NPCs who embody a specific philosophy or skill set. They are not simply trainers for hire; a hero must prove themselves worthy of a master's tutelage. This usually involves completing a difficult personal quest for the master, aligning with their worldview, or simply impressing them with a great deed.
Example Masters:
Valya, the Trap Artist: A reclusive Runeforge Remnant who can teach the art of creating complex mechanical and runic traps.
Fenrir, the Frostfang Loyalist: Kei's hot-headed but skilled rival who can teach the aggressive, high-risk hunting tactics of the Frostfang warriors.
The Silent Gardener of Wyndia: A mysterious, ancient figure who tends the gardens of the floating city and can teach Nina how to better commune with and command plant-based spirits.
2. Becoming an Apprentice
Once a hero has earned a master's respect, they can become their apprentice. A hero can only be apprenticed to one master at a time.
3. Unlocking Newfound Talents
While apprenticed, a hero gains access to a unique "Talent Tree" specific to that master. By spending experience points (an optional resource) or achieving specific narrative milestones (the default method), a hero can unlock Newfound Talents.
These are unique SFX or abilities that are not part of the hero's two core Paths, allowing for greater character customization.
Example (Apprenticed to Valya, the Trap Artist):
Tier 1 Talent: Expert Sabotage. You can now use your Intellect die instead of Agility when setting or disarming traps.
Tier 2 Talent: Runic Snare. Spend a Plot Point when creating a trap Asset. The trap is now magical, and the target must overcome its effect with Spirit instead of Agility.
Tier 3 Talent: Masterwork Trap. Once per session, you can create a d10 trap Asset without spending a Plot Point.
This system encourages players to engage with the world's lore and its characters on a deeper level, making progression a result of their character's personal journey and the relationships they build.
Optional and Expanded Rules

Trauma and Scars: The Weight of Legacy
This is a significant optional rule for groups who want to fully embrace the "Fatalistic Hope" and "Cost of Power" themes of Dragon Legacy. It introduces a system for permanent consequences, ensuring that the struggles the heroes endure leave a tangible, lasting mark on who they are. This system is heavily inspired by the permanent, life-altering injuries and traumas suffered by the characters in Berserk.
1. What is a Scar?
A Scar is a permanent Trait that is added to a character's sheet as a result of a significant trauma or sacrifice. Scars are not temporary Complications; they are a lasting part of the hero's story and identity.
A hero can gain a Scar in several ways:
When Taken Out: When a character is Taken Out of a scene by a Stress die, the GM can offer the player a choice: either the character is removed from the scene as normal, or they can choose to stay in the fight by immediately converting their maxed-out Stress die into a permanent Scar.
Through a Deal with the GM: A player can choose to automatically succeed on a crucial, life-or-death roll. In exchange, the GM can inflict a narrative-appropriate Scar on them.
As a Result of a Major Narrative Event: Completing a major story arc can result in a Scar, representing the emotional or physical toll of the journey.
2. The Mechanics of Scars
A Scar is a new Trait, typically with a d8 rating. Most of the time, it functions as a Complication. The GM can add the Scar die to an enemy's dice pool or use it as the basis for a Difficulty when the Scar would realistically hinder the character.
However, a Scar is also a part of the hero's story of survival. Once per session, a player can choose to leverage their Scar. They can add their Scar die to their own dice pool, representing how their trauma has taught them a harsh lesson or pushed them to be stronger in a specific way. When they do this, they must explain how the experience of gaining the Scar is helping them now.
Example Scars:
Haunted by a Friend's Ghost d8: (Mental Scar) You failed to save someone, and their memory haunts you. The GM can use this die to hinder social interactions or cause you to hesitate. You can leverage it when fighting the person responsible for their death, turning your grief into fuel.
Grievous Arm Injury d8: (Physical Scar) Your arm was permanently damaged in a fight. The GM can use this die to hinder actions requiring fine dexterity or heavy lifting. You can leverage it when pushing your body to its absolute limits, as you are used to fighting through the pain.
Mark of the Void d8: (Supernatural Scar) You were touched by a powerful Void creature, leaving a cold, dark mark on your soul. The GM can use this die when you are interacting with holy or pure entities. You can leverage it when trying to understand or resist other Void-based powers.
Runeforge Blueprints: The Lost Art of Creation
This subsystem is a direct expansion for the hero Rune and his Path of the Guardian. It is designed to create a long-term personal quest for the character, encouraging exploration and rewarding the player with tangible, unique upgrades that reflect the lost genius of the Runeforge smiths. This is a system of discovery and customization, inspired by the equipment and crafting systems of classic JRPGs.
1. What is a Blueprint?
A Runeforge Blueprint is a rare and valuable item that contains the esoteric designs for a golem modification. These are not simple diagrams; they are complex techno-magical schematics that only a being with Rune's unique nature can fully comprehend.
Blueprints can be found in a variety of ways:
Hidden in the ruins of the Runeforge itself.
In the possession of collectors of rare artifacts.
As a reward for completing a major Event.
Carried by high-ranking members of the Arcane Dominion who have been studying the Remnants' technology.
2. Installing a Modification
Once a Blueprint is found, Rune cannot simply activate it. He must find a suitable workshop (such as the forge in a friendly settlement) and have the necessary rare materials. The process of installing a new modification requires a "Settlement Turn" or a significant period of downtime between Events.
When a new modification is installed, it replaces the existing modification in that slot (Core, Arms, or Legs). The old modification can be stored and swapped out later, allowing Rune to build an arsenal of options over time.
3. Example Blueprints
Here are a few examples of Blueprints and the Talents they grant, which would replace the default mods on Rune's character sheet.
Blueprint: Thunderclap Gauntlets (Arms Slot)
Talent: Arc Discharge. You can spend a Plot Point when using the Barrage move to unleash a burst of electrical energy. This attack targets all enemies in your immediate vicinity and inflicts the System Shock d6 Complication on any who are hit.
Blueprint: Kinetic Recycler (Core Slot)
Talent: Energy Conversion. When an enemy's attack roll against you fails, you can harness the kinetic energy of the missed blow. Gain a Stored Power d6 Asset that can be added to your next physical attack roll.
Blueprint: Mag-Lev Actuators (Leg Slot)
Talent: Skirmish Thrusters. You can spend a Plot Point to use the Maneuver move, hovering a few feet off the ground. For the rest of the scene, you can move freely over difficult terrain and liquids.

Afterword: Your Story is the True Legacy
You now hold the completed core of the Dragon Legacy TTRPG. You have the rules of this broken world, the stories of the fifteen heroes who struggle within it, and the tools to bring it all to life at your table.
But this book is not the end of the story. It is the beginning.
The world of Eryndor is a place of fatalistic hope, a world where the darkness is deep and the victories are hard-won and often bittersweet. It is a world where the only true shield against the abyss is the found family you build along the way. The rules, the characters, and the lore contained in these pages are merely a foundation. The true legacy—the one that matters—is the one you and your friends will create.
To the Players: Embrace the struggle. Lean into your character's flaws and fears. Make difficult choices that have permanent consequences. The Scars you collect are not punishments; they are the story of your survival, written on your very soul. Protect your found family, not just with your sword and shield, but with your trust and your empathy. Your story is not about becoming an invincible hero; it's about remaining a human one in the face of inhuman odds.
To the Game Moderator: You are the keeper of Eryndor's secrets and the voice of its heart. Be a fan of the heroes. Challenge them, yes. Push them to their limits. But also, give them moments of quiet beauty, of genuine connection, of melancholic victory. Let them build a home in this sad, beautiful world. Let them feel the weight of their choices and the profound, defiant joy of a hope that refuses to die.
The rest is up to you. Take these tools, take these stories, and make them your own. The Age of Scars is here. The world is waiting for its heroes.
Go, and forge your legacy.
